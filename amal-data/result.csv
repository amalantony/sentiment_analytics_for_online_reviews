You can reset your Iphone that could help out.  Just press the home button and power button at the same time and hold until it reloads.

Apple Iphone 2g have Android?

I love my 2g/8gb.  True I don't use any online apps or anything else.  I just need the contacts and phone most and the camera and ipod ocassionally.  I think its the best phone in terms of battery, usefullness, cost etc.Nice try from Apple but?

-Camera lacks anything (another cheap 2mp sensor and that's all)

-3.5 inch screen with only 150.000 of total pixels? (decent one must be at least 230.000 per this size of screan)

-Video player is a nice thing to see but there is absolutely no indication of video speed? (30 fr per second or crappy 15 fr/ps?)



THOSE NEGATIVES WILL BE A DEADLY FORCE FOR THIS SO-CALLED PHONE!

Hopefully mp3 player will work ok!

sweet phone.

i wish it had a better camera resolution.

but then ipod is famous for the music player. well, nothing's perfect.

let's just wait until it hits the market.
this thing is going to get so trashed in my pocket, which means i'll have to buy some fancy apple case for it for 50+ bucks, and look like a giant douche bag pulling it out of my pocket, THEN pulling it out of the fancy pouch.  ambient lighting?  movement sensor?  touch screen?  i hope the tech support lines are wide open because all of you know how REALIABLE your ipods are (/end sarcasm).  my best pal is an apple genius worker at the soho store in NY and he says this thing is going to be a hardware, software and technical error fest.  great start but this thing looks like a nightmare...
I think the phone's downfall would be it's battery life. A dedicated player like the ipod goes dead within a few hours while using the screen, which is smaller than the iphone.



Nice pone but I still think the other big  manufacturers (Nokia, SE, Samsung etc) don't have anything to worry about because they have a huge portfolio of different phones for different niches. For me, I need a phone with a good camera with autofocus.
ok, for the ones who dont know the exact price of it it will be costing 499$(4gb)and 599$(8gb)this cellfone its everything youve evrr wanted it has everything in a small compact wide screen cellphone (16 million colors)as a comp.OH and by the way it will be on stores on june in us.end of year in europe and 2008 in asia y want it NOWWWW.
Touch screen could be a problem. does it come with a stylus?

you people dumping on the phone should at least read up on it before you go making decisions.





http://www.apple.com/iphone/


saying stuff like touchscreens suck, this is not your normal touchscreen smartphone.  it's made out of zirconium to reduce smudges and scratches.  it uses technology that WE HAVE NEVER SEEN!  this is not some touchscreen licensed from any old company like nokia or samsung or motorola goes to when they want a touchscreen phone, this was created FROM SCRATCH by Apple over the past two years with over 200 patents.  you have never used anything like this so please don't judge until you can get your hands on it.
This phone is the best I have seen so far. You need to have to buy a laptop, an mp3, a camera, a blackberry, and a gps to cover all the super features. Would be better with a usb port or shaped like the ipod nano. More memory, micro sd slot, bluetooth, and infrared would make this PeRfEcT!!!
wow, nobody said anything about the screen being 16 million colors.
Does anyone else realize the STRONG resemblance to the Motorola A1200/MING? I personally own that phone, and I like it.



I am quite fond of this device, HOWEVER, as my experience in the A1200 is shown, I would like to point out that the hard buttons are generally easier to use than touchscreen, especially while on the move. I think it looks sexy, however  I am not too confident in the operation.
large screen, crappy resolution.
awesome, if it has 3g, it would be aaawwwwwweeeeeesssooommmmeeee!
the camera is too basic

the overall functions are way too good to be true!

safari browser, touchsreen, large screen, itune... etc
That's mad cool.. The price is gonna 699 for the 8gb, and the 4gb i think its around 499-599..   I want it ^^
just uaoooooooooooo!!!! 8g and large display
Very Dissapointed in this mobile from apple....lack of features, I was Expecting more, a better camera to be exact, larger amount of memory and 3G
you gotta wonder how it is gonna be its the first of a series and yeh most firsts are a flop!!  well done to apple thou very nice the only real downfall i see is no 3g but still i would buy if its not too expensive
fenomenal this is awsome if you dont afford n95 get this one
Has tiger installed in it!!, 10.4.8!, best mobile...and from Apple!, apple always comes out with innovative ideas and products, eg iPod, and the sexy Macbook and Macbook Pro
Have been a Mac User for 8 years. soo I have to get that phone if OSX inside :)
naresh, my personal opinion is that's still a good phone but insufficient. I have this phone and it uses iOS version 3.1.3. I can't download and run most apps from App Store today. I recommend newer iPhone with iOS 4.0+ installed and also suggest Motorola Atrix 2 if you search an Android phone.

Amazing device. Yes its expensive. But its the best phone you will ever come across. I love my iphone. I had a samsung galaxy s and it wasnt good as this for me. So if you only have $50 for a phone, i would recomend a second hand one of these.
It's a great experience to use I phone,but mine can't facebook or tweet.any suggestions/help guys?
This handset is superb, All Apple handset are good,

but some problem apple has,

Its prize



They gives best service, but its so much costly

this is the most stupid iphone ever
This Is a very well made phone
good
i phone is bestim the first person to post!!
Apple Rulez!This phone is great, and has everything I need except I need a phone that has 3G technology. Is there a model coming out soon with 3G?



Thanks,

jannie
OMG this is THE ULTIMATE PHONE!!! the slickest, most tech savvy phone in the world! beats nokia and SE!!! OMG im gona get this on y bday on june!!!
woah!this is what i call phone!! awesome!! i hope they will tell how much is this thing. i check on apple.com theres no price mentioned.
$499 full retail for the 4gb

$599 full retail for the 8gb



that's before carrier subsidy which hasn't been announced.
how much do you think this will cause ...
A so great and awesome phone and...

it has MAC OS and not Win or Symbian at all???



:( but I should guess it, it is apple!
oh that's right, 200 patents.  the answer is NOTHING!


http://www.apple.com/iphone


--- Built-in Advanced Sensors ---



iPhoneï¿½s accelerometer detects when you rotate the device from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display, so you immediately see the entire width of a web page or a photo in its proper landscape aspect ratio.



The proximity sensor detects when you lift iPhone to your ear and immediately turns off the display to save power and prevent inadvertent touches until iPhone is moved away.



An ambient light sensor automatically adjusts the displayï¿½s brightness to the appropriate level for the current ambient light, thereby enhancing the user experience and saving power at the same time.



please tell me what else can do this.
CooL ! big though ...
"THOSE NEGATIVES WILL BE A DEADLY FORCE FOR THIS SO-CALLED PHONE!

Hopefully mp3 player will work ok!"



lol, coming from somebody named "Nokia."  no wonder you're upset since your piece of crap internet tablet has just been outdone.
great looking phone..gotta love those apple designs..one question though ..I know it says google maps ..but that doesn't mean gps does it? is it an external gps receiver needed or does it use the mobile network for navigation?
It's OK, but I'd like to see a review of it.



The fact that it has MacOS X on it is pretty good, but I'm worried about its stability and compatibility most of all.



I'm also worried about the screen. Not quite sure what to do with a touch screen and how to protect it...



I think people expected something different...





Harlekkin







What I am looking forward to seeing is the screens durability. After 6 months of smudging the screen with your fingers will the screen still be usable for watching videos?
BIG!!!It's too damn BIG!!!I was expecting more lighter and smaller.iPod has done too much now...
Whether it allows mail client for mail reading & document reading support?
none of the features its ground breaking, and the n80/n90 have a better resolution.
Not to mention google maps! - the apple alternitive to the n95 - cool stuff.
Very nice, but i tend to agree with other popular opinion - no 3G, what a shame. Checking out all the specs and comparing to other pda style phones, the resolution is phenominal! 16 million colours is outstanding, well done. The phone on a whole is revolutionary - the slimmest at 11.6 mm, and the slide to unlock function is pretty cool.



2 thumbs up from me! Can't wait til it hits Australia



Nice phone.Good job Apple.I will buy this one as soon as its available cant wait.I think nokia should take some tips from apple on design...Really nice spacifications.....
I first saw this phone on the Apple website a and was stunned by the fact that Apple lunched a new branch of product. This is an incredible phone, I never though that someone would actually comme up with such a nice designed phone. The specs are great with a Mac OS X operating system. There is no Edge or 3G but who cares, it still the best phone out there for me with all the great features.This is a wannahave!!!!
The phone only has one button!!  would you be able to play good mobile games on??  i hope it doesn't come w paratrooper and brick!!!

Phones need an 8-way control so i can play SF2 type games, not this 4 way stuff...
dis s a great fone...

but i wonder i much it cost??
This phone looks pretty cool with all of the features and everything but does it have a non removable batt like the ipod?  Those proprietary batts cost so much to replace!!! Still like Nokia phones though...
I'm just concern about the reliability of  the face of the I-phone? As all we know,  you will be using all the time your finger tip to scroll and browse in the internet. I owned an Ipod and I know for the fact that the unit can easily scratch the face plate.
how many of you guys/girls who have negative comments actually get what this phone is capable of doing....? This a MAC with Tiger OSX operating system (for those who do not know what this is, go to your local Apple dealer, and try out their computers, that is what it's all about, just the same as installing Windows XP operating system into a mobile- does that exist? anyways who cares it would probably crash every second minute), and its a phone and its an iPod and a movie player and and and. This phone is capable of everything to be exact. And it will not crash more than any other mobile thats for sure, trust me!



Ok it does not have 3G or GPS, but not to worry Steve Jobs already announced that its under development... My only worry is the BATTERY that is im sad to say not Apples strongest sales argument around!



I simply cant wait to get it..... just a damn shame I have to wait until end 2007:-(



No 3G - criminal, Apple are meant to be a forward facing company, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA. I'm a life long apple fan, but this takes the biscuit. Unless the UK government decide to give us free WIFI (VERY unlikely - in 2007 anyway) you'll be waiting ages for a download (drain on battery). Ever heard of HSDPA? Its the future (for us in the UK). Also i've owed a few ipods and every single one has needed a silicon glove to stop scratches, cant see how this amazing touch screen can resist all those keys and coins in our pockets. I'm getting an N95 (5MP camera and 30 fps video AND GPS)
nice design....
C'Mon guys - there is not a lot to get excited about. Yes it's Apple's first foray into the mobile phone market but the price, coupled with the size of the device - will you really want to use this to replace your iPod and mobile phone? I think not! Take samsung's i300/i310. 3 - 4GB internal space. Smart features, great size. C'mon apple, you can do better than this!
Outdated tecnology, add an apple logo, and its a hit. Naahhh!
Sux! Age old technology
look man its a good design and let them have there time in the light this is the very first time this has been done and all you critics out there are getting ridicolous because no phone is going to be perfect just because you had a issue with the phone doesnt mean everyone will and vica verse so let it go
Truly amazing piece of hardware! and the OS is a brilliant combination of eye-candy & ease of use(see the demo on apple.com). But no 3G, thats disheartening!
I think that the idea of this phone is more for storing music and DVD's rather than taking pictures and besides a 2 mp camera will still take a good quality picture.



As for how to drive and text I think you need to concider if you should be using your phone while your diriving as its not the best idea!
also NO 3g so mobile internet will be slow as balls
naaahh...ugly phone...

i dont like it...

i expected that iphone would look more cooler and more features...
this fone ,i must say is one of the most wonderful gadget today !! but they forgot to put 3G functionality on it !! and it only has 2 megapix which is not enough to take superclear pics N95 has 5 megapix !!!!
I suggest you see the presentation of this phone on apple.com to see what it is capable of doing, and you will see that this is the greatest mobile phone yet! NO applications for this ?? it has MAC OSX with COCOA support, that means that nothing is impossible to develop for this phone. it will be just like developing for mac....
Brilliant piece of art, but im curious how will this phone be operated using one hand, and the "smart" qwerty keyboard.
how much did most of you guys pay for the phone? 4gb and/or 8b? around $400-600?This is truly an amazing phone. Apple did it again! It better be good cos I am going to dump away my Nokia and Sony to go for it.













This is a better phone than most other similar phone in the market. However, I would prefer a 3G phone over WLAN. Samsung i760 and Nokia N95 have these features built in.
what is the video recording rezolution and the batery life & the most important what is the price?
LOL are you joking apple? next year release? nokia N95 this year, i don't think you've though this over..... no speakers? every normal phone has internet 2mp camera and a music player y is this speical? it has the letter i infront of it? and its gonna take up more space than the Nokia N95 in our pockets...
Even it has all the bugs that could be in any phone, I am buying this damn thing the minute it goes out commercially - Apple is a Marketing Case that should be tought in all business schools



Cheers
Could I use a similar office (word, excell, power point) in this phone?
Doesn't look half bad! Though we won't get it in Aus for at least a year! time to throw away my ipod and mobile :) i'll be getting this one
i will buy this phone. i don't need 3G coz indonesia sucks in internet connection.. people here pay about around $100 to get 512kbps connection. lol.. lousy country.. anyway, i think 16M colors is truly amazing and have you guys ever go to

http://www.apple.com/iphone/
? you ll be suprised..
No stylus ... big mistake
its waaayyyy tooo bigggg for my pocket...
Looks awesome!
Really like the new iphone but dunno if it really makes sense by introducing a phone sans 3G and a better quality camera....No FM tuner either.....Apple products r amazin but 599 for a phone without all this....May b a tad too much.....the next version of iphone will b the one to watch out for....
Beautiful but no 3g. Why? i think US customers are the latest taster of the latest IT technology. No wonder Treos are so so product.
i'm in loveee.....

let's see what this lil'thing can dooooooo
I have been using NOKIA all those while. No more. I guess the R&D team better do some thing. Bec the design has been outdated & SonyEricsson & Samsung is doing a good jobs. Now it come Apple iPhone. Nokia soon will be place trying to catch up. Bec lately Nokia phone nothing innovative. New model but so what function same design nothing new.
more question than opinion..

is it windows compatible??

like if i hook it up to my windows computer, will it perform??

thanks
I got to try out this phone for 3 days! Oh my gosh! It is the best phone ever!!! It may be a bit pricey but its so cool
The touch screen features are great and the memory size is ample for a phone but what is the point of making a phone that is internet oriented but not making it UMTS or HSDPA? The data speeds will be terrible.
did someone say apple will better thn nokia?

hope they will, cuz soon nokia will be releseing 5mp and high pixiel screen.
it better have a dam good battery


from what i heard.. $500
It is so saddening that this thing doesn't have FM radio and infrared port. Sony Ericsson P990i remains the world's most advanced and favourite phone.
I hope the touchscreen is scratch resistant otherwise u have to buy protection sheets and covers for it which will take the fun out of it. Most of the ipod in the market don't have scratch resistant screen.
I hope the touchscreen is scratch resistant otherwise u have to buy protection sheets and covers for it which will take the fun out of it. Most of ipods are not scratch resistant.


this is just like the lg ke850 prada phone.

-- everyone said it looks the same so i came for a look... and

all i can say is... design.... its the same........

................................................Â­ï¿½...............



and again, the proposed GPS is not a gps tracker, its a bloody map system that doesnt know where u are, u have to know urself!! whats the use of that! it can navigate, but what if u enter a wrong street? it wont be able to re-think its way around, so ur screwed on ur camping trip or holiday or whatever, the "GPS" is a total waste by apple. i love the ipod, hate this. all it is is a pda, i wanted a phone with GPS, not a map system that cant track ur location.



Dear Mr. Steve Jobs,



Are you missing yourself somewhere? You want to conquer the world but you just looking your eyes in north america. THINK AGAIN! Europe and Asia are the gratest market of cellphones, lack of 3g on your new toy is just a big, not to mention "too-soon  announcement" for next year product is just following the footstep of Siemens/BQS to graves. Nowadays people are  too bored to wait, believe me 2-3 months there will another product which replacing your device   shocking cell-junkies.



But you still have times to keep your product as "toy of the year"! It's by releasing your product within 2 monts from now (to the whole world not just US-cingular!) and having triband UMTS/HSDPA included.
i like my ipod the way it is. it's convenient, but..
ok, i know it comes with a 2 year singular contract, but who will the contract provider be in the UK. because if its vodapoo. that will put me off :-( any ideas?
it will cost 499 for the 4 gb and the 5 gb is 599. but it is exclusively for the cingular
it's going to be 499 USD for the 4GB version, and 599 USD for the 8GB. BUT, those prices are when you sign up for a two year contract with some us operator compagny. So what the price is going to be in Europe...? I'm guessing the same amouts, but in EUR, and without a contract. So, 499EUR/4GB and 599EUR/8GB. I'm going to buy the 8GB for sure.

Do you think if we would buy a phone in the US, will it work in the EU? It supports all 4 bands, and the qwerty-azerty matter is just a software level, so why wouldn't it?
It wasn't introduced as an Video Ipod so the memory is fine. Besides the intentions of the device is to be phone thats more advanced then the average phone in many ways. What phone do you know is literally made of a big touchscreen with strong music and great video support?? Most phones your lucky if you can watch a movie at a decent quality with a doable screen. I think this phone will indeed revolutionize the mobile industry...wether people will like it or not.
Argh, Cisco's IPhone isn't GSM.



Patent fights can go a long way.

Looks good, but symbian might still be better. Wouldn't mind this phone, but would still choose symbian over it
How in the world will I play SNAKE on this phone?!?! God awful design, and touch screen means that it will scratch itself like whipped cream on hot summer bread.



This is worse phone evarrr... I am india! Bollywood iPhone!
The "iPhone" name belongs to Cisco. Not to mention "Visual Voicemail" that belongs to Citrix:

Tsc tsc Steve Jobs. So much for "think different".



By the way, where is Cisco's/Linksys IPhone on GSMArena?

quote: "but 3-4 years behind everyone else's technology."



are you crazy. the iPhone is 'at least' 5 years ahead of other phones technology wise. Apple has over 200 patents on new technology put into the phone. just because it lacks 3G and sat nav dus nt make it crap. i agree with ThatsWrong, get sat nav in your car. thats the only place you'll nedd it.
to those who say, why no stylus? this iphone has multi-touch technology - multiple fingers at a time, stylus suck...

to those who say wont be as good with email as blackberry etc. it will, it looks much more simple with rich images etc. blackberries etc suck.

to those who say too big. its not that much larger than an ipod and you carry that around and a mobile. that sucks.

and the phone is amazing also, how simple to merge calls, hold send while on call etc. wow. other phones suck.

and who cares if n95 has a stupidly large camera and sat nav. i have sat nav in my car, and a perfect figital camera. why the f*** would i want that on my phone. n95 sucks.

iPhone rules!

i think its hot could someone get me this for my xmas its sooooooo hotttttt
ITz 500$ for 4gb n 600$ for 8gb in US..pretty nice. too bad it's just a slimmed down, upgraded version (2MP vs 1MP & and more memory)  of the nokia 7710, that was out in 2004!

oh a link.



http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7710-921.php
man there is nothin revolutionary abt this phone. 1st of it will b comin in asia in 2008. in 2008 a phone with 2mp camera, no 3g, no office apps, no card slot, no radio, no tv out & costing $600 pathetic.



plus this is the 1st phone by a company so who knows how many hanging problems it will have.



as far as 8gb is concerned, in '08 it may be nothin big.
Mr. Job, there is still time to make some corrections before d iphone is released, notably d almost obsolete hardware, d 2mp camera, the non inclusion of video recordin, sd slot, 3g,  &java. Iphone is destined to be the phone of d year, pls dont cripple it!
Apple has been working on this design for almost three years.  if they copied, why is their device the one with over 200 patents?  why does it have the superior screen and functions?



LG was in the dumps working on the first Chocolate phone slider while Apple was in the labs working on this.



LG got lucky but their phone is the same old touchscreen on every other PDA right now.  it's also not of the same quality.



the magic to iPhone is Multi-touch, a technology which belongs to Apple.  here is a video demonstration:





http://video.google.com/videop...923853181774


the screen of iPhone is cutting edge, it is the future.  Apple will soon have the technology in touchscreen Mac tablets, the iPod, more phones and whatever cool new devices they can think of.



the LG KE850 -WILL NOT- be able to do this.  it is likely the same old screen you can find on handsets today.  and THIS is NOT.
no matter what other ppl say, apple did make history because iPhone is really very different than current phone although some of the features are lacking (2MP camera - no zoom or flash,  no SD/MMC or external storage capabilities, currently no 3G/HSDPA etc)... My only hope is that while waiting for the iPhone, apple could announced a new iPod that have iPhone features such 3.5" LCD, multitouch screen, full HTML email & browser, bluetooth 2.0 EDR... therefor we in asia or the rest of the world don't have to wait until mid or end 2008 to feel the power of iPhone... that's my 2 cents
hello guys

i just seen on cisco site that this phone is being sued for the name they are using by the real iphone owner of cisco phone whihc is also iphone, apple wont sign their form so they sued them also the 2007 design winner is being copied by this "iphone" from this phone LG KE850. plz ck it out iphone wake up and see before your apple iphone goes apple phone or someting diffm and also n95 clearly beats this phone just touchscreen and screen size. thats it ,, and also who want a big phone?? and LG KE850  is another phone which is copied by this phone and can kill this phone but dont; know
i am with you mxcx

apple rules, mac rules, iphone rules!

don't you know that are only jealous :)
Stop going on about that FUGLY n95. seriously who needs satilite navigation on your phone, get it in your car where you are most likely to use it you lazy sh1te. and 5mp! wtf is the point get a decent camera!

and stop saying that mobile internet has been around for years. the current net available on all mobles, even n95 is shocking. its not real internet. its "baby internet" as Jobs says, the iPhone has full internet capabilities. FULL!

its clearly all you PC folk that want the fugly n95 because you have no style and are tch geeks. APPLE RULES, MAC RULES, IPHONE RULES! Who's with me???
I think this phone is cool looking... but no 3G capability? No GPS? only a 2 MP camera(there are a bunch of 3 MP camera phones on the market right now, and the N95 with a 5MP will be out soon.) At least it has Wifi built into it. If I were Apple,I would add the 3G functionality, maybe raise the resolution of camera to 3MP and possibly add GPS... that would be a really nice phone.
First of all, go to apple.com and read the specs, watch the keynote and decide for yourself what this device actually is. it is not a phone, it is something else..I have always dreamed of something like that and it finally comes true..whoever says i have a prototype of this phone, id say you wish! Probably the person who has a prototype of that phone is Jobs..anyways, the control system is a revolutionary one, the biggest after the invention of mouse..I am having nightmares about when I can get this phone..Id be the happiest person if i only get 10 minutes of play time with this device..The thing I dont understand is why they are waiting until june to release this one..As far as I understood, its all ready, completely working..Why are you doing this to me Mr. Jobs?
I have heard that you can download stuff (music/videos/programs) for it only from Apple's own services like iTunes etc (can someone please confirm this?). Very nice and versatile multimedia device? Programs will cost a lot for sure. It explains cheap price.



Touchscreen is not benefit. It makes screen look damn dirty because fingers are greasy (nice look photos/videos from it?). You can't use gloves or have long nails. With long nails its hard to control and you will scratch the screen. besides this touch-screen has usually pretty short life.



They should have put Li-polymer battery at least on it because big screen, thin body and built-in rechargeable non-removable battery are great disadvantage when we are talking about battery life. Battery lasts no longer than a day.



And what new things this brings? First internet phone came out 8 years ago.

First music phone? No hell.

First touch-screen phone? nope.

All together? Still no.



(HTC P3300,HTC P4350,HTC TyTN,Qtek 2020i,Qtek 9000,Qtek 9100,Qtek S200,Sony Ericsson P990i anyone?)



In videos I watched from internet I saw that americans where flashing Samsung phones as phones which are so out dated. In fact samsung has more than 15 MP3/bluetooth phones  at market. Samsung is just easy brand to blame because koreans doesnt seem to have WLAN to offer(atm).
The price is pretty mcuh high, 500$ for 4GB and 600$ for 8GB ?! you gotta be kidding me

i think they ddint increase the memory size and no memory slot is because if they do, iPod's will run out of buisness for sure
also some people are wondering about why they are not able to install programs to it, the reason is that Apple want to control all the capabilities of it, thus, you want to get a new widget to your phone ? you go to apple.com and into the iPhone section, same as in you have a Mac PC(Personal Computer)
It's not bad at all, as stated by some one else, it's OS X NOT OS X 10.4.8

It's release date really is bad, June 2007 for Cingular users at US Only, Q4 of 2007 to europe and 2008 to us asians !!! and the camera is going to be really bad at the time of 2008, 2MP only ? no video recording ? very bad for the issued release dates.
I guess I'm gonna buy this phone it's so great it has everything I'll need in my mobile phone, and there's no need to download any application on it, it has already everything u may need, I wonder how much the price of it will be?!
iphone is a slap on elders of cell phones lke Nokia ,moto,sam,SE as they achieved these features after 10 yrs,price seems resonable touch screen is best,we r very anxious to see it much before.hats off to Apple///////
the hardware is crap, but we have to admit that the the touch-sensitive screen is revolutionary. i might consider buying the next generations of iphones, i believe they'll improve a lot. till then i'm very happy with my SE w810 and i won't change it soon.
does anybody knows if there is a video recorder function ?
This is, by and large, one of the biggest thing to come from Apple. However,while the software is definitely top-notch, the hardware is confusingly archaic. Why put out a product to be globally available in 2008 using hardware of 2005? And you can't justify it saying, "well it doesn't really need this or that..." Come on, who are you kidding? And if you're waiting for upgrades such as a 3-5 MP camera, future 3G, etc., etc., why didn't Apple come out with it in the first place? 2MP is already run of the mill by today's standard and will soon be rendered obsolete once N95 raises the bar to 5 MP. And this thing is bringing in 2 MP... in 2008?



Of course we can point out the niceties in Steve Jobs's keynote speech. That's conceded, this thing has GREAT software. But why sell your clients short on the hardware? Because that's what it is: Selling short.



I'll be waiting to see the magic of this beauty... aewsome! B-E-A-UuuuuTIFUL



"GSM ARENA team": hurry up! and take a test drive a.s.a.p..."They're targeting this very same phone (as the keynote speech says) for an Asian release in 2008, and what will it boast of? 2MP, no 3G, no HSDPA. Are you serious??"



what are you friggin kidding me?  this is the same company that comes out with a new and improved iPod every six months.  you honestly believe that by 2008 this will be the same phone?  unchanged with no upgrades?



my god, it will probably be updated with HSDPA before it even comes to europe later this year.



this is not motorola, it's APPLE.  use your head people.  they don't sit around and let the competition creep up.  there will be new and better iPhones every six months probably.
This is what I have been waiting for. All that I need in a phone will be in the new Apple iPhone.
They're targeting this very same phone (as the keynote speech says) for an Asian release in 2008, and what will it boast of? 2MP, no 3G, no HSDPA. Are you serious??



To those saying, "this isn't a camera anyway..." this is not addressed to you.  This is for those who actually care about the hardware.  And what outdated hardware this will have when it comes out.
This phone features are great. Some of are revolutionary features, But the problem It do not have 3G, Auto Focus, 3MP camera, 3D speakers. I hope Apple will add those features for their 2nd phone and hope it will release soon after launching this phone till that i will wait..
Sorry, camera with only 2 MP. POOR
Hey why don't you order it to be shipped to asia? Dats how i get most fones, even the NEW (January's) LG Chocolate. Thank god they don't got the regional codes for the phones yet, like the DVD, HD DVD or Blu-Ray games/movies/devices !!!!
Right now I'm using a PSP for watching videos and web browsing, an Ipod for listening to music and a Rizr for making phone calls. Though the Rizr is sexy, the IPhone is beautiful. I like my PSP but i rarely use it for playing games, I just rather watch movies on it than on my Ipod. I live in The Bahamas so the issue with 3G does not really matter to me. I only hope that this phone is sold somwhere unlocked at a price within $200 of its contract price, if so I will get it.
let's not forget that motorola rokr e1(we could say, the first mobile from apple) was a disaster. i believe the iPhone will have an average success. maybe the next generations of iPhones will be better, or in the mean time, microsoft's gonna come out with something alike and wipe out the iPhone. we'll see...
leave ur mp3s at home. leave ur pmps at home.... everything will be solved by iphone.

with iphone, its not that hard to imagine...

lol
I think this is the best mobile phone ever..

and i wonder why people are dissapointing the camera.. for god's sake,, this is a phone, not a camera.. camera is optional,,

overall, iPhone is the best,,, beware Nokia, SE...
I think it's genius! I've waited so long for Apple to bring out a successor to the old Apple Newton (remember those things??)



I still have some reservations about the battery life, even though the same when for my iPod which has been fine.



Also, I feel that using multi-touch instead of physical keys might be a bit odd on a phone - but if I trust anyone to create a brilliantly intuitive user interface, its Apple!!
This phone is great , it has everything that i need  which doesn't include 3G ((like i use it ))



the screen is off the chain  and i thing its the first mobile to use the Multi-Touch Screen



Apple will use its own Software ( Mac OS X ) which is really powerful and fast ((people who own Apple computers would know )





10/10
Good looking, but lack of some options.

---it's have no any Flash option.

---It's not 3G.

---Battery not changeable.

---i think price must be little bit reduced.



I am surprised when I hear people there's nothing great in this phone. This the best thing that happened since the mobile phone was launched (OK, the price is steep). 4/8 Gigs in Flash Memory (Not A hard disk which slows down the performance), 2Mpx camera (this could have been improved say 3mpx). An awesome interface and great resolution. This phones have 200 patents filed after its launched (not that its supposed to be THE indication for a great phone). If and when its made available to general public, I will surely dump my ipod, Nokia 5500 (sigh, big mistake) and my tungsten C for an iphone. Though I still feel that 3G should have been included.
I actually saw the phone in Moscone Center in San Francisco at the Macworld Expo. It looks nice of course. But actually the only revolutionary thing is the Multitouchscreen and  that no pen is needed. Other than that, the phone is nothing special. For me it is kinda overrated. Also I would like to see the multitouch on a lot more PDAs. Another thing is the Mac OS on it. It's there first PDA OS when I am right. I hope it is stable. I won't buy it since I like the XDA Orbit. It has more functionality and a GPS for less the price. Doesn't look that good, but Windows CE is kinda stable.
"From what i saw, heard and read, I conclude that the iPhone is nothing "revolutionary".



There's still too many unknowns about the device."



Lol, you come to the conclusion that the iPhone is nothing revolutionary, you say the camera sucks and the touchscreen poses many problems on top of many other reckless judgements while simultaneously saying "there's still too many unknowns"?



LMAO, CalX you're a hypocrite to the fullest.  you've given us a review of the device and you probably didn't even watch the keynote presentation or watch a video demonstration, let alone holding and using the handset for an elongated period of time.
This phone has serious potential, ignoring all those who were quick to judge, this phone looks remarkable and has the functions to match. I hope Apple comes out with a better battery for this phone by the time it's released or it should come with at least two extras, this is the only downside.
very disappointing about the camera
Overrated!



From what i saw, heard and read, I conclude that the iPhone is nothing "revolutionary". There's still too many unknowns about the device (even it's final name, since Cisco has the Iphone name patented). First of all, the design reminds me of the Dell Axim x51v handheld without camera and call capability. Here's my biggest concern/issues with the Iphone.



1. Touchscreen

Very sensitive, leaves fingerprints and drains battery life faster than usual. Texting and browsing the web (the need to type in web address) will be a serious problem. I find it difficult to fit all the alphanumeric characters and symbols without making each character size smaller, thus making it difficult to "touch" to type.



2. Battery

Correct me if i'm wong, but i heard that iPhone's battery is not removable. If that's true, then i'm very concerned that the battery will simply die out after 6-12 months (like the first generation iPods) and I'll have to spend god knows how much money to get it repaired/replaced. I also doubt that the battery life to listen to music will pass my current phone (SE w850i), which plays continously for 20 hours.



3. Camera

No Flash? Are you kidding me? At such a high price I would expect to have at least a flash to take pictures at night or inside nightclubs. And to be honest, in my opinion, i dont really care about the "advance" photo editing software. It's unpractical to edit a picture in a cell phone, especially one without a stylus and keypad. I can image someone using a photo editing software for basic crop and maybe red eye removal. Anything else, I rather use Photoshop on my laptop or pc.





Overall, i give this phone a rating of 60/100 just from specs and opinion. I never touched it or tinkled around with it, but from with my experience with previous touch-screen devices (Axim x51v), I don't see what's so great about the iPhone. The only thing that impressed me was the standard 3.5mm jack builtin the phone itself, which is very good since you won't be needing an adapter. The Google Maps seems impressive as well at first (since i do travel quite alot), but i realized that without internet (Wi-fi 802.11b/g) it's pretty much useless. I would rather spend my money on the Nokia n95 which has builtin GPS which does not require wireless internet signals. Of course, i hope things would change by June of 07, and i would defintely love to try it out. However, i think the only thing that's going to change is the name of the iPhone. I just hope iCell isn't patented as well. If it is, well Good Luck Apple Team lol



In all,I would wait and see what else is on the horizon. I'm sure Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola are all developing a new generation of cell/smart phones and i would compare them to the iPhone. As of this moment, I don't see the iPhone being that impressive.

This phone is the best phone that is comming out to the market.For those of you that said that it has a bad camera,then let me remind you that is a PHONE not a camera. also those said that this phone doesnt has good memory the, you are crazy because its the same memory as the black ipod nano which is 8GB and this phone holds videos and it has safary wich is the best ethernet right now and i know that because i have an apple computer. so all of you that are saying  that this phone sucks then go stick to your nokia wich is as big as my T.V. controler,no I'm just playing aound  because my T.V controller is smaller than the Nokia phones. SO BEQUIET $#&^%*@!?If this phone had a 3g it would be a perfect 10 but it is still a must have as a 9 out of 10.
i work for cingular and while the features on this phone are really slightly different then the treo 680, other then the camera, i can not wait for this phone to hit the shelves.  i love the new concept for their touch screen.  also the new os looks really interesting.  really the reason i look forward to this phone is not my love of macs but my hatred for treos.  i am kinda hoping that palm sales drop because i hate seeing them get returned.  so apple plz put god awful treos out of business.  thanx apple.
I dont have no clue why every one is going nuts about this phone. Other then 8 Gig and safari browser every thing else is ancient. HSDPA is already history HSUPA is arround the corner in US and rest of the world is already knocking at the doors of 4G. Bottom line having this phone means having the best computer out there possible on a dial up connection, not worth $500 at all.
nice!

Nothing new to the table apart from Multi-touch. it seems easier to use however i think people will be as lost as they already are on smartphones.



The technology of 2007 is gps, safari, hsdpa and 5mp cameras'. This only has one feature that sounds interesting. (safari although the N95 has it and other models to follow will as well.)



if we look at the SE-P990i rubbish model yeah i know... what makes this a better handset? i will compare becausem this hadset is the worst in it's range but still is better easy to use and flexable program wise.



when you look at this hand set ask yourself what does it bring that's new to the world of mobile phones. what can you do with your smart phone or mobile now. for america yeah ok they haven't got grate phones but the european and japanese market??? we are so far ahead why go slightly back in time.



This phone will sell.  Not because its the best out there. It's not.  But because its much easier to use than anything out there.  Steve Jobs was right...the current generation of smartphone, however, great technically, are hard to use.



This phone will create its own market like the ipod did by moving low and mid-range users into smartphone territory.  I am betting this will be the first smartphone for a lot of people.
the internet browser is also safari on n95....and if u ppl read the link

http://www.symbian-freak.com/n...5_vs_n93.htm
it proves that nokia n95 is the best phone up till now and is certainly better than iphone


I think it was a nice move for apple to come out with the apple iPhone. The iPhone has most features consumers have been waiting to have. I also think the price will not deter people from buying the Apple iPhone. I even think they will sell more then the 10 million Apple iPhones they expect to sell within the next year.
Hi all,



this phone and its features are great. I 'ld love to have one.
What cracks me up are the comments that this phone is really advanced, because it has email, camera and mp3 player.



Does anyone remember the time when phones with these functions were first launched? I don't. And as if running safari browser would be something revolutionary. Many smartphones have been running opera for ages.



And using internet with 3G is about 10 times faster than with this phone.
i'm gonna buy it for sure! the design is certainly worth a 10!
Don't think apple will make a smartphone without the capasity to install programs on it...It allways the same people are hooked on the f**ing windows well that a good smartphone...Apple is great and they make perfect products...Wait untill you all see the sales they will go skyhigh...Time for revolution...dont be stuck forever on traditional unpractical phones...
i totally agree with you people need to stop bashing this phone before it even has a chance to get on to the market. if people are so concerned with the camera then why dont you buy a digital camera that way you get the ulimate pictures. its a phone for crying out loud not a fricken camera! this phone has the highest quality internet of any phone on the market today even the nokia doesnt have that. the internet it a fully fuctional internet just like the one you would get on your computer in fact i own an apple computer and i use the internet safari that is one this phone and its wonderful. i think this phone is over all really nice and i think it looks a lot better than the nokia anyway
to all the people on here that hate this phone why are u spending your energy on posting rude and useless comments about it. the phone isnt even out yet so no one can really judge it yet. technology changes every few months things become out dated with in months of buying it so yes apple will come out with an even better phone. the first ones always have some bugs to get out or something that should be replaced. i think we need to give this phone a chance before we bash the crap out of it. and to all the people who absolutly love the nokia phone then stop bashing this one and post comments on the phone you really like. apple is a wonderful company and they make really good quality things so i have high hopes for this phone.
A great phone one of the best on the market.8gb that is nuts the i phone rocks.
This's bad comment's mine. That's a test and I'm a programmer. I'm sorry about this.
That's a great iPhone, it's shape so realy nice and I'm looking forward Apple out it early. This's iPhone's leader of mobile phone technology.
I think this is a great freshman attempt by Apple. Not a lot of companies can get it right the first time so I think this is what's next. Not saying that it'll be all peachy I guess we should expect some hiccups here and there. But I think I'll be part of the revolution and get it once it's sold in Singapore.
Apple guys, please add office applications and java support, sd memory and FM transmitter accesories.
I can't deny the wow factor of the device, accentuated by its thinness atthey didn't have to dissect the iphone to know that they just have to ask their sellers. that means the comparison its so away from the truth probably by margin of 70$-100$ max. STILL apple its a rip.
this is an unbelievable phone and if you want to see it in action just log on to

"www.apple.com"go to the iPhone part click on the key note video

but you have to have quicktime,

this also can be downloaded in the site!!!
this fone is gonna cost alot(cuz apple is a rip), and seeing that its apple that made it its not gonna last long espescially because its the 1st fone apple is making. this fones is not going to be worth its price whatever the price may be.
The Prada phone rocks this one 100 - 0. Sorry for the yankees, who can not buy the Prada phone.



Well I guess, Prada knows where the people live, who value style.
this phone is just awesome. it comes with most european languages and a few asian ones too. already told the misus what my christmas present will be...
anyone know what language the phone have,or only english?
CMOS is a type of sensor.



QVGA is a resolution.



They are unrelated.
wut is better for camera quality: CMOS or QVGA?
has anyone thought that the 4 or 8GB storage isnt big enough bearing in mind this is meant to be the widescreen video iPod that everyone has een waiting for? Not sure if you're gonna have enough storage for a few movies/shows AND enough music as well.



I agree this is one hell of a sweet phone, I'm just waiting to see which UK carrier gets the rights (hope it's O2)
....Beast....
with the memory, we'll say that's the price of an iPod nano 8gb which is $250.



with the video capabilities and large sharp widescreen, let's add another $50 to meet halfway between the iPod 30gb with video and 8gb iPod nano.



this phone, right off the bat, has a $300 iPod inside of it.



to those who have always wanted to try an iPod or need another, you are getting a new phone, an internet communicator, a PDA and a widescreen/touchscreen iPod for $600 without the need to lug around three seperate things like you'd normally have to.



i'd say that's a pretty good deal.
" Lastly, now that we know how much the phone costs...."



WRONG.  that was an estimation done by looking at pictures of the phone and guessing.  they DID NOT dissect an iPhone.  they DO NOT have any idea how much the components cost and who supplies the parts.  they DO NOT have a clue as to how much R&D went into this over the past 2 and a half years, which included designing this brilliant touchscreen from the ground up.



that estimation is nothing more than wild guesses.  try again.
The iPhone costs Apple only $250 for the 4GB phone and $280 for the 8GB version to manufacture according to some reports.



And though Apple has to spend on R&D and marketing and other business costs but for the most part, those costs would have been incurred anyway.  I'll bet that Apple spent relatively little to put the iPhone together since it really didnt develop any new technology here just integrated different existing tecnology really well.



THE BUZZ WAS SO GREAT, THAT APPLE PROBABLY DIDNT NEED TO SPEND A DIME ON MARKETING.



Lastly, now that we know how much the phone costs, it raises new questions...why didnt Apple create just one version of the phone (ie 8 Gigs) and why didnt it improve some of the specs that people are complaining about, like the camera or lack of 3G or lack of GPS (these chipsets cost $5).



Seems to me like Apple chose profit over their supposed desire and ability to serve the customer.
Ok... I think maybe this is a device for people that need a SUPER iPod and "also" a comunication device... Don't know, ppl always espect that all phones made have the same TOP features ... man, exist something called market economy.. target groups... a phone is not bat because don't have what you need, it's fool. I like this phone, Mac do awesome products... I only wait for this iPhone not to be as unstable as an iPod... I saw the launch video, yep it comes for windows too... recomend you to see that video. I will buy it... in 3 years.... lol
Yes! The best iPod ever.  But I need a good phone so I'm still getting the N95 with its clearly superior features any day.
To be honest, if you have this cel, with 4gb or 8gb, you can put lots of music,you will thinking in radio? I have a nokia6265 with 1gb, a never used the radio.
jus what apple has 2 do was this one. but not 3g
it is the ultimate gadget that anyone can dream of....... i am waiting......
i love apple company products and i also like this cell phone plzx tell me about this cell phone price...my cell number is +923453879528 plzx sms me.

thaknkx
As this is a relative of ipod, I doubt if it has radio.so it will gona work also in europe? with vodafone operator? somebody says that iphone doesn't suport GSM band,what that meens?
the phone rocks !! ZAG ZAG ZAG
On the first look, this thing rocks. But after reviewing the specifications and all, it is quite a disappointment. I guess this would appeal more to light pda users and people who desire form over substance. Prefer something like HTC's devices. HTC is not as cool but functionality wise, HTC kills Apple. Still, a good effort from Apple.

Mult-touch screen - GREAT!

4/8GB offer - SWEET!

Wide-Screen Video - *drools*

An ACTUAL internet browser- FINALLY!



I am definitely going to buy this as soon as it comes out. I have been using the Sony Ericsson W900i for almost a year now, and I'm looking for something different as a cell phone. Apple gave me the answer.



Sure the Iphone only has a 2MP camera but honestly, that is enough to print out a decent quality of a regular size size photo. Anything over that is overkill and you might as well get an actual digital camera.



Radio - For me, I don't listen to the radio that often. If I do, I have the car or my audio system inside the house.



Everything else (GPS, voice recog, size-matter) I can live without it. Apple will definitely upgrade/improve the Iphone as time goes by.
This one very good. Touch screen only. 500 usd or 600 usd. Never mind I will buy it after it go to market. But my phone must have 3G. Cos here I can watch TV in the phone by 3G.
Well to be polite



This thing isn't that bad but apple is definetly a 3 years behind current cell phones, the N95,N80,N93 and Sony Ericsson P990 have far better features than the Iphone including a auto focus cam present on the n95 and n93 and also they are all smart phones which are able to install and run programs increasing their features.



Apple doesn't seem to have really thought it out very well when they were designing this phone, sad it looks great though.
so, why doesnt it work for tmobile? dont they use the same network?  I mean, just use the same SIM card that Tmobile provide, and put it in the Iphone, i wont work that way?



no umts - no buy!
i'm a mac user and this is definately going to be my next cell phone the moment it goes on sale!

There are a few certain drawbacks, however:

1. No 3G. - I'm European but I live in the USA, and I can tell you that the mobile phone technology here is at least 3 years behind europe, and at least 5 behind Japan and Korea. The phones are ridiculously simple with no design, no functionality and the cell operators control the software. The 3G network here is only in a few cities, so I'm not surprised the iphone does not have this feature. Once it comes to Europe in the fall of 2007, I'm sure that it will support 3G.

2. Here in the USA, the ONLY carrier for the iPhone is Cingular. Apple has chosen them to be the exclusive operator. So, if I want to get it, I'll have to: A) Cancel my T-Mobile service agreement and pay them $200 dollars in early cancellation fees. B) Sign a 2-year agreement with Cingular, an operator which does not offer anything more than T-Mobile for me (except the iphone) but yet will most likely charge at least a good $80/month (compared to 50 now).

3. If the iPhone is made of the same high-quality plastic like the iPod it WILL get scratched in just less than a day. Apple say it's more durable, but I have to see it to believe it.

Still, even having said all that, it is still a revolutionary product (at least for the USA), and the fact that it will INTEGRATE perfectly with my mac is the main reason why i'm getting it once it comes out. :-)
yes the iphone has a  video recorder, yes it has a camera, and yes you will be able to download your own music onto the phone/ipod
1) no 3G

2) no Radio tuner

3) Camera only 2M

4) no xenon flash

5) no UPNP

6) No GPS

7) No TV Out

8) No Infrared

9) no voice recognition

10) Video capture is 15 FPS (not good)

11) no push to talk

12)Heavy compared to other phones

13) Very Big phone

14) No A2DP support

d phonz awesome but shud be equipped wit a gud screen!!!
same ipod mistake again-- no fm tuner ,no user replaceable battery ,batter will cost u about 1/4 price of phone to replace ,same shiny glossy plastic gets scratch easily,and where the hell is 3g and they are not shipping stylus with this we have to use our finger all the times and gets fingerprints everywhere on screen.
lacks ONLY 3G...and I will definitely get one!!!
i guess iTunes would be the best option instead of an mp3 player as such and I guess Apple wouldnt mind that too.. wud b gr8 if they include FM radio with RDS
very nice picture
Really it is good looking, surely it will create more expectation on apple i phone & the screen is attracting. i think but sending message will take more time to type & send -- but it is a product of emerging technolgy, youth surely like these like mobile. really nice to look & create more customer to apple, surely customer will expect many more models & nice rate will be expected from Apple--- my conlusion is good not very nice
is goooooood
this cell is the best!you can use Google Maps for GPS, but good arguments about the battery. That would be its biggest flaw. Batteries tend to degrade.
:-O ....did my pants just get tighter?!
Dis is gonna be da bomb only if they could upgrade the camera nd also make it with a memory stick den it's gonna rock the world men........ Apple ur da best always buy Apple
2mp camera only? no slot? no 3G? non removable battery? Is this a good phone btw?
Regarding Email:

I tried apple's website but couldnt find the answer. REgarding email its not said if we will be able to synchronize contacts, emails, etc. with our Microsoft Office applications such as the Outlook.



It will have a PDF file reader in order to read research, etc. on the way?



What about those Ebooks. It will have a program that will allow to read the ebooks on the way too?



Im really tempted of buying this phone, but dont wanna spend that cash and find that its lacking performance, etc.
Battery and endurance needs urgently an enhancement. All those nice features are to use them. Not just to know and tell people they exist. But if you use them, you burn your battery in just a few hours. Not even a quarter of a day... ridiculous.

I cant believe such a design, such integrated features but a battery that its consumed in just a few hours if you use them.



Also I support the idea that the camera also needs an enhancement. Better quality and a good flash.

phone of the future

big world in small hand
This phone wasnt made for europe nor asia markets. Thats why its features are out of date, U.S is far behind in phone technology its a fact. Of course it will sell in U.S as its a apple nad the phone market is so small.

wtf !! ummm os :( whertf will i find software for this umm like i get all the cool applications and games fr me symbian phone or even the java j2me stuff but this oneee !! and 2 mp cam gawwddd ar u guys livin in da 1930 zzzz  ? the phonez got a nice look to itt sophisticated and all but i dun fink touchscreenz are the rage anymor !! umm even thgh the dual things cool like in the "W950" .. ahh its overpriced othawise i wld hav been typin this out wid me w950 lol and no cam gawdddd !! all id like to do rght now is waiiittt and if they dun shell out sumthin for me soonn .. dude am gettin that brick homee .. umm whts thattt .. ermmmm ummmm yeahhh the "N93" hehe .. although i guess nuffin wld beat this i fone in terms of snob value but thn utility is the need of the hourrr !!! heheheh !!
cant they put a gps on it instead of google maps?
first of all this seems like a great fone except for the camera( no flash nd its only 2mp)and theres no 3G. AND y da f cant u change the battery. i like it but it seems to need upgrades before it goes on sale
my precioussss!!!!!!
"iphone doesn't suport GSM band,"...???

look:

GSM 850 / GSM 900 / GSM 1800 / GSM 1900

is it GSM? yes, well, it will work with any EU operator
i thought that apple should have kept the Ipod by it self instead of joinging it with a phone. My idea would have been to put portable I tunes on the i pod so u can by music from ur ipod
this is one really nice touch phone

Why would you buy this phone when you can buy the mutitude of new phones coming out in 2007 with the ability to recieve live tv ? there are so many phones that have every feature minus the touchscreen in it and also play tv?
Im not going to buy it at 500 dollars for an iphone maybe when it goes down in price in a year and my 4gb nano breaks i will buy the 8gb phone so i don't have to switch between my phone and music player. someone told me by winter of 2007 the phone will go down to about 350.This is phone is extremely GORGEOUS!! OMG! It got everythings in it (Except 3G). 4GB is adorable for a phone.. I cant wait for it to come in Asia! lols :D
of course it will be the best phone in all over the world but it had to have 3G and less price but if it be even 20000$ I will buy it
it's surely the BEST phone in the world... when it really reach our shores in Asia (maybe mid/end 2008)... but i hope apple would release  a no-phone ipod based on the iphone specs before that... maybe mid 2007 (while they release the iphone in the US)... so we could familiarize with new, revolutionary multi-touch UI... and may be it will be harder to tie up with operators in Asia compared to the US...
Five years ahead of time, according to APPLE, phone batteries will last for only five hours and not removable immediately. Actually it shoyuld be around 20 - 40 hours talk time takin into account the recent advancements in battery technoilogy (that is in five years).

I think APPLE should start focusing on their products user frendliness rather than mocking all other phones on the market. I like their products look and cool factor but are crippled in many ways and treats users as idiots
I meant no flash in the previous post.

Memory card slot would be much helpful so one can transfer stuff wihout connecting the device to a computer and for the stuff u do not need in the phone for only a few minutes

Another thing it has the APPLE connector, crazy people put a standard USB interface, retards.
Phone looks great and soft keys makes sense to me, atleast.

Not a standard screen size 640x480 would have been much better

No GPS, google maps does not tell you where you are in the middle of nowhere and probably you need the data service to use it

Apple says that it is fdive years ahead of time and it uses a two MP camera with flash, funny

Editing office documents, PDF files, VOIP through WiFi do no how it will be implemented since it uses Mac OS X

Voice dialing and voice recognition for typing can easily be included since it runs Mac OS X

I would not get this untill it has atleast the GPS and proven toughness.
love it! great design great features but no 3g..but its still fantastic and its performance is remarkable..!!!
hey brandon, yeah ur absolutely right about the sound quality is going to kiss a$$ big time, but about the touch screen man...u gonna like it for the 1st few week, after that, u gonna suffer typing the sms's u gonna get fed up of it, u'll end up just calling ur contacts hahah, iphone should make a mini keyboard to it, and make it look good on it.
For what is this huge screen when there isno't a 3G and when I can't watch TV on it??
does it got aim?
ive had all the ipods, the best cells no cost worrys!!! turn off my ipod to talk on phone or swichted to mp3 phone and still no phone or mp3 player has as good quality sound or loudness !!! this iphone is gonna be the best beetween both worlds .cant wait to get it 4g thats all i need for everything and this phone will do it all.and has cool touch screen wat else do u want!!!! get over your selfs!!!!!
has any video recorder function or only video player?

pls somebody reply



tks
OMG if u wanna know when itz comin to USA then f'ing watch the keynote on APPLE. FYI its comin out in june/july nd only available wit a cingular 2 yr contract
I at this point the product look great, BUT and there is always a BUT! it would be a great dissapointment if this phone turns out

NOT to be a smart/pda phone. Can it run 3rd party apps like regular PDAs?? There is no mention. I run many programs on my pda (e.g GPS, medical apps....)

only time will tell i guess!!!
Did they forget the flash during designing stage? And cant change battery??? What on earth is wrong with these designers? I still regret buying my ipod nano cos other music players perform better.
my Godness! it's a nice phone... but without 3G?  umm.. i think i'll wait for iPhone ver.2.0 for more complete features :))
why a memory card slot, comparable phones like the n73 or n95 only have  a memory card slot limiting the phone to 2gb, this has 4x the memory, i can understand some people needing 3G, but why a microSD slot in a phone with 8GB?
Y DO PPL WANT CARD SLOT.. when it comes with 4gb or 8gb.. even MMC doesnt go more than 2 or 3 gb shii it comes with 8gb.. then 3g i dont we dont have dat in usa.. so i dont really care about dat.. only minus should had GPS.. but i can live without it... its a nice phone i think
nice phone and i was also amused by it's new unique cool features, N95 is somewhat already  booring mobile coz since from N91,N80,N92,N93/i only few things have changed like increasing camera resolution, adding GPS and updating OS version, nothing more. apple has awakened the eyes of nokia. a real N95's rival.
Why no 3G? Doesn't make any sense......yes, its an awesome and it's the best phone



too expensive for 8gig storage

simply over-rated and simply ain't worth.

i'd rather waste my money on a ps3. :D

that's just me
oh my god this is the best phone i have seen on this plannet i love it who cares about 3G
iphone has created a hype,it has to be too cautious,n delivery of what people expect.Otherwise it would be counter productive,being its first ever cell.The glass should be tough unbreakable,unscrathable and still weightless.Hope Apple would note NOW!.
holy cow wat the hell thats not real! its magic! its a witch! wtfkin 8gb!!!
Awesome phone. I don't miss the 3G: Apple can see the future. 3G is not there. :)
Suppose the touchscreen breaks or stops responding. What happens then? I hope they've got a good non-touchscreen control method.



Also if this phone is coming out late 07 it'll be outdated by the time it does.



nonetheless, haha @ all you apple fanboys salivating over this. If another company were to be making this phone instead of apple, you wouldn't care at all and call it crap and ugly.
Oh cmon Techy Guy! Still loads of great features to make this phone worth it! an iPod Video, organiser, full-internet device and desktop-class apps and networking via Mac OS X?? Superb stuff!



too bad apple did not include the 3G function, duh!



not worth your money.
Ignore me - found it! Just watched the Keynote, and its in the top of the phone!! Amazing!
Superb phone! Shame about the battery. This might be a dumb question, but where does the SIM card go??
That's a Rippa

Beauty!
Just a shame we will get it late and expensive compared to the USA, jus join the queue for handsets on ebay.  Given that this is a "widescreen" phone it seems unlikely that the pixel dimensions above are correct, they would give the standard VGA 4:3 ratio, widscreen should be 16:8 or 16:9 - unles they are using rectangular as opposed to square pixels - that would be pretty unusual for apple.  Is someone guessing the specs?
i wish i can get this phone is it going to come out in xmas it is too sexy and very gangsta lol
16 hours of music with the battery. not bad.
hu needs games on a phone. i never use a fone 4 games. this is "THE phone" to hav, its an ipod, a phone, and wireless internet usin apples safari browser. i watched the presentation on this phone on the apple website. its pure class. my phone is the samsung d900 and i wuld swap from a 3MP fone to a 2MP iphone. no other make is gonna make somethin like this. this is atleast 5 years into the future. trust apple 2 make sommin as good as this :P
It is too early to talk for this phone. wait & let see what is that.Reality will be in front of us as the fone come in market.
This phone is a joke. Buy it if you want, but it is just a toy phone. The battery life is going to be hillarious. I cant wait for this phone to flop.
you are actually concerned with how a PHONE will handle playing games...good idea cause cell phone games have always been top notch!  haha
i dont like it and it booooring ring  hi ipone i told u i dont want you. this is to busines 4 me and has not have ipod style it shold not be cald the iphone it shold be cald an appel phone
People been talking about this phone in the US thinking it such a great phone. I'll give a good credit for the touch screen and the internet browser friendly but the camera is bad

also the list, wifi,edge, battery,signal,and much more. I believe that Apple should just stay with the IPOD and nothing else. Even the Ipod have a bad record for the problem that it has about 30% error compare with most other electronic. The average for electronic are about 7-15% but 30% is too much. So I would suggest anyone to get this phone.Thisa phone very nice.Me like this phone.Dosa this phone work in Ghana? Me want thisa phone in Ghana now becase me make thisa phone presant ta my motha next moth and my motha will very like much thisa phone.Thank you.
with all the GB inside the cellphone, you don't need a card slot, ï¿½and infrared? too obsolete
lol why need a card slot with 4 or 8 gigs? card would be unnessisary
the Iphone will be 3g when cingular picks it up
no 3g no video conferencing in this day and age what are they thinking. sorry apple but its quite shocking.
i hav always loved apple. this phone rocks!!

i love apple. they create the best stuff on earth. all i want to do is get a macpro to use macintsoh, rather than the shitty windows, but i just bought my toshiba :S. the iphone rocks, who needs 3G?? the network here still sucks!! the iphone 2 will rock for sure. who need a 5 mp camera, i dnt even use the camera other than family and friends pics. the technology on this device is all about using the touch screen. if this phone spec sucks, dont worry apple will rule the cell phone market in about 2 years with other phones. Like they did with the ipod. first it sucked... 4gb black andw white. upgraded to 40 gb, upgraded to 60 gb colored, upgraded to 80 vedio, made an 8gb colored tiny one. WAIT AND SEE WHAT THEY"LL DO IN THE CELL PHONE. THEY WILL SURE CRUSH All WINDOws opertaed phones, they'll crush nokia for sure samsung, i-mate, siemens, even se. APPLE RULEZZz!
No 3G no slot memory so no good.
Does anyone know whether iphone includes office applications? something like MS Word, Excel.. n synchronizing them with a PC with Windows??
i think it is a good Phone in the market
i ont know wat ya want but 4/8gb memory iznt enof 4 u?

IR iz old.
yo Racerpaki, Keynote just schooled you man, maybe you should do more research before you start making opinions about the iphone. Remember Racerpaki, GSM's disclaimer on the bottom states that,



"We can not guarantee that the information on this page is 100% correct."
To Racerpaki, You wont have to worry about pressing touchscreen keys accidentally with iPhone when on calls: it has advanced sensors, one of which is a proximity sensor which disables the backlight and touchscreen when held to the ear. For more info on the advanced sensors, check out

http://www.apple.com/iphone/te...sensors.html




enjoy!
i phone is superb !!!! i see keynote and they mentioned you can download your email or pause your music and video in background !!! as per my thought its muct be fist dual core cpu inside

and hope iphone will be top of the market and about 3g ??? they most advance people they know all !!!! and i think they will surprise you alll lllllll llllllll
hey i have nokia n92!!! really nice phone worth buying unlike this garbage!! i always hated apple but i like how it looks but still i'll spend my money on the gold version!!!!!!!
i wonder how annoying this thing would be when you actually use it as a phone. I mean what happens when you put it up to the side of your face and suddenly your ears starts pressing all the buttons that you don't want pressed? thtz messed up!!!!!!!!! i really like this phone but im really concerned about the touchscreen and the camera i have nokia 6270 right now i wass looking forward to this phone but ohh well i guess sumthing better will come out to compete with iphone and please for god sake don't compare iphone with lg prada!!!!!!!!!! i seriously don't recomend people buying this phone! waste of money!!!!!!
No card slot?????

No infrared????

2MP camera only????

No 3G?????

what kind of crap is that??? My p910 is way better(being 3 years old).



Pssst. Allready signed for news letter to recieve iphone.

:)





it is a very cool phone.
1) bulky.

2) pricey.

3) not available in CDMA or for T-Mobile.

4) no 3G - you'd think that a big player like Apple would try and take advantage of every big technology around.



but for some reason - it's still arguably the sweetest phone out there. :-P
can i use the iphone in south america?
to the website advertising iphone for $550 - sure, the price will get to that, eventally, anyone can now take pre-orders of this phones and will deliver sometimes in 2009.Not a lot of people need 3G (some just want to be entertained), so this will be neck and neck with the N95. I'm assuming its graphics and picture is going to be way better than any other phone, because, well, it's from Apple. Better than a low-screen resolution Sidekick/hiptop. Don't complain about not having a card slot. Are you really going to use up 8GB on your cellphone? Face it, you're not going to listen to 8GB of music. You're going to skip majority of them. Stop bashing the phone until you actually try it out.
When we are waiting !
Well I really can't wait to get this phone
Every thing new really draw me away from the old one. Iphone may gives me an exellent experience although Samsung F700 refers 3G. Good integration Ipod and phone is interesting.
This is the best iPod made (and also a comm device) If I buy it .. I will use it more for that: music... ok if it's 4Gb are in flash chips... if it's in disk.. SAY NO TO DISK ON pods. About the zirconia, sounds nice, I only complain about size.
The phone is actually running their new OS Leopard on the phone. And yes it has the same features as other phones, like nokia but some people may not like nokia, just like how someone does not like any other phone company. If you dont liek it dont buy it, apple already knows about you and dont care if you buy, they have their market already.
The fact the this phone is running OSX 10.4.8, the same OS thats on my computer at home tells me I can do anything with this phone. It runs widgets, (small programs). Last time I looked Apple had over 3000 listed for free!
This is only of those things from apple, just like the ipod, when it first come out, everyone has one, it WONT be so special after a while when you see everyone is holding one. I never had ann ipod and neither i will get this phone, dont like the look and spec of it. Also, think abou it people, this is the first time apple produce any mobile phones, should we trust its functionality?
this phone will have real problems competing with the nokia n95 which has pretty much everything including almost 2mb/s download speeds (1.8)
Haroon, maybe this innovate when don't care slide keyboards (N95 need slide in two side to solve the problem in multimedia mode) or shell  style or book style(like nokia 9300) or uncomfortable stylus (in sony W950, I never know if use keyboard or stylus AND if this touchscreen really work why came a keypad)

The innovation in iPhone are the multi-touchscreen mode. This release more space for screen you can get any virtual keyboard and don't care slides one. This is very slim.
I don't now, the N95 cam apparently  don't so good in

http://www.gsmarena.com/3gsm_2...ew-129p2.php
and for use the maps you will pay the Tele Atlas. I prefer iPhone that use google maps and bigger screen.

Can any one answer that iPhone support SIP(voip) over wifi??
Iphone looks really nioce but as far as specifications concerned, nothing is new in it. you can easily find all these features in N80 or N95 even with higher resolution camera, 3G, .....



Iphone rating must be around 4 out 0f 10.
i luv luv luv luv luv luv this iphone i want it sooooo bad but i f****in got the bloody Lg KG800
But as its so wide and tall it barely fits in your pocket and also u need two hands to do anything with it. Ofcourse the multitouch screen is awesome, but are u sure you dont want the old and easy-use keyboard back after few weeks?
with this phone starts a new era of mobile phones...the main innovative function is the the 16M colors TFT display with Multi-touch input method and also the accelerometer sensor for auto-rotate...it doesn`t need a card slot; i think it`s 4/8 GB of internal memory it`s enough. I can`t hardly wait to be released in Europe
Also those of you complaining about its size just for relativity its 7mm taller then a BB Pearl, and about 3cm wider, but about half as thick...which means its the same size as you average BB or Treo, or p910 except alot thinner
Why does everyone on here think they are a phone expert. Yes one phone may have more features or this or that. But how many of you have honestly used all the phones that you compare to this. Further, this is just a primary release, and the specs will most likely change when it comes time to release just like any phone.



As for why it doesnt have 3g or a radio or this and that, haven't you ever heard of there being too much...when you try and pack a million things into something you end up having problems...and anyone who has used a motorola or nokia knows that.

Manufactures are not stupid, especially Apple, a company that puts alot of time and development into products...there were hundred's of other iPhone designs before this one and previous phones probably had all those features you want, but they probably did not work together or resulted in poor battery life or caused a negative affect. Which is why they are not there, its not like they stick there hand into a box, cover their eyes and pull out slips of paper with the features they want.



Stop your complaining about everything and try and understand that the reason why companies make more then one phone...because they obviously cant satisfy you whiners with one product. Apple knows who there demographic is and its not every Tom, Dick and Harry out there; which is everyone complaining on these boards
This phone does not surprise me, maybe the price will. Nothing new about it. Almost all the functions can be find on other phones. The design is okay and clear resolution screen that's what i find impressed. Can not record video with the camera and no FM. I think we will HAVE to buy the accessories to get those functions. Don't forget about the battery, if is build in like ipod. First month 14 hours of music. Few months later, less than 4 hours.
The concept is really good. But making it available through Cingular with a two year plan isn't. I love the ipod features, yet 4/8GB is not a whole lot of space for videos and without an external memory card slot, it is held back.
apple without FM radio? this is a joke right?Camera sucks man , If there were a camera on this phone , all other phones would have been disapppeared in comparison with this one !!!!
the multi-touch screen is a new idea and thus this device has a new feature, and it is a 'smart' phone, in that it does a lot of things most high end phones do, but it being a closed system, as far as we know, hinders it being a smartphone.

but for the euro market, it really needs to be 3G have a forward VGA camera, a 3MP camera, with auto focus, and flash, and be an open system.

at the moment its an awesome device, but it needs these features to make it perfect.
You stand to be corrected sir... even among "toys" it isn't the coolest.  The coolest looking device? Arguably yes. The coolest smartphone?  It isn't a true smartphone. As you said: "..the coolest toy.."?  No. Among other relevant features missing from this device the absence of 3G is the most glaring. Other high-end "toys" have that.  In all honesty this unit is the bimbo of the communications devices: real pretty to look at but no substance whatsoever.  Plus, it doesn't even come close to offering smartphone capability so why put it in the same price range?  Why charge the same for a push-cart as you'd charge for a twin-engine v8 (especially when I read somewhere that it costs less than $200 to manufacture)? This is a phone, not a smartphone: pretty, but still simply a high end phone.
To akuma7703:

What you are saying is completely true, but even the iPhone being a toy, it is THE coolest

among toys!!!
when is it coming out on the market??

they said it was gonna be around 500 USD ryt?

tahts a pretty decent price, cuz look at the nokia 8801/8800 which was total crap from experience...it only had the look which i loved =P but that phone was around 1000 hwen it came out and this phone has soooooo many more functions in it and its touch screen...wat more can u ask for
There is theory and there is reality. Unfortunately we live in a REAL world and today (23th of Feb, 2007) iPhone is theory.



In 2-4 months when this mobile will be introduced, a 2MPixel non-3G mobile may be it will be obsolete. And the BIG boys (Nokia, Samsung, SE, Motorola and even HTC/Gigabyte/O2)will make sure to make this model obsolete. They will direct the market fairly quickly to other toys and with ZERO expertise MAC in mobiles, will be a dead meat!!



You will see, by the time they will formally introduce it, most mobiles will be 3G and 5 MPixel Camera. The 2MPixel will be ancient Greek history....and we will be wondering may be Hercules and Agamemnon when invaded Troy had iPhone!!!



NEVER MESS UP WITH THE BIG BOYS!! UNLESS there is strategic decision from MAC that will enter TELECOM market and they are willing to loose initially a lot of dollars. And, may be if they will make the correct strategic moves with other products to follow, they may have a chance but only in the future they will make money.
Please read all I'm saying before accusing me of flaming. This phone is garbage...it could have been the "one" but some technical choices seriously marr it.  From a design stand point nobody can touch Apple's designers- the unit is beautiful.  But that's it.



The phone is NOT revolutionary.  I don't get this sudden uproar over "touch-screens", "feature length movies" et al...have you guys never used a Pocket PC before?  It also IS NOT a true smartphone... it runs on a closed proprietary system- Apple is not enabling third-party software OR modifications, ie: you're limited to what they authorize/give you. You cannot make the phone do exactly what you want it to do orbe what you want it to be.  That's not a true smartphone, it's a good phone and nothing more. My PPC is my tax-auditor, my banker, my accountant, my navigator, my researcher, my remote control, my browser, my encyclopedia, my dictionary, my movie/mp3/wma/ogg/ac3 player, my playstation/megadrive/super-nintendo/gameboy advance, my word-processor, my spreadsheet- heck it even tracks my girl's monthly cycles.  That's a smartphone...not this overpriced toy from Apple.  If Apple opened the system up then we'd be talking. But honestly this unit does nothing new and doesn't do enough to be called a smartphone.
There are no side volume keys.  What were they thinking?!
WOW Finally !!!!!! APPLE had introduced this new REVOLUTIONARY MOBILE !!! Itï¿½s brilliant! think i couldï¿½t wait till the sale starts in Summer07



3 Devices in one an perfect slim one.

A perfect Smartphone / iPod / and the best Apple Software combined in this smart Phone !!!





Bye Bye !!Windows Mobug!!
If anyone has questions, PLEASE go to apple.com before you post a question, like how you do sms text messaging on the iPhone.

On Apple.com, you should click until you get to the Keynote link. Watch the keynote, and all of your questions will be answered!
i can no longer wait...



how to text (sms sending)? i know time will come apple make something useful like makin a keyboards or etc. for that right? like speakers for ipod, right?



i think after releasing this fone itz already 3G ready, i dunno we will know after they lauch it..



ciao!! cant wait to grab this fone, i hate p990i it suckz!!
You shouldnt be using your mobile when your driving.  It's idoits like you that end up killing people. Wise uP!!!!!
I would like for all of you who would like an iPhone to just take a look at the Nokia N800, which I think is the biggest competitor. Touch-screen, same scrolling-function, SD card slot, and 3G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pleas send me more picture of apple iphone
First, about the size... I drew the iPhone with its correct measurements, and it fits my palm perfectly. About the performance, how can anyone vote about it, no one knows it's performance since the iPhone is'nt out yet.

And about the iPhone not having 3g, not a big problem for me, but I understand all of you who would like to see a lense on the front enabling

3g. I think Apple already has made an iPhone

with more capacity than 8 Gb, but they are just waiting to realease it to amke money...

this goes for the 3g-function and SD slot as well.

I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT...i am on the waiting list at phonelounge co uk, can't wait
does it come with like one of those pointer stick things like what palmpilots have, cuz i can imagine the screen will have a lot of smudges.
well i'd love to have one but i actualy wont buy it cause sms is one of the important thing for me in the mobile and am use to use it in the car but tuch screen :( i cant send while am driving
its greaaaaaaaaaaaaat
I have just read though some of the most stupid comments ever! No itunes! who put that? it an iphone offcorse it's gona have itunes!!!



Any way this is the most awaited phone in the history of mobiles no other phone has a two year hype of 'will they wont they' and will be aimed at a consumer market that is very broad. Not just tecno freeks and geeks.



This alone will make that iphone one of the top electrical consumer products of 2008, along with the widescreen ipod which will be realeased realitvly soon.n99 rocks 20 gb memory that is equal to my pc hard disk i want n 99 when does it come out n did i 4get to mention 8 mp camera

it looks good on the outside but not that great from the inside by the time it is realesed nokia would be leaps and bounds ahead of apple guess there is no beating nokia

This phone really isn't that great. It  lack a lot of key feautures that are important in sucessful mobile phones. Such as 3G, expandable memory, ect. Not to mention most of  the features, excluding the display, are of low or average quality. For example, the camera  is only 2 megapixels, it doesn't seem  to have a flash, or auto focus. There are no specifications given about the video quality either. So  there really is no telling on how good the camera is. It only has 5 hours of talk time, so standby would most likely be between 200-350 hours, which isn't very good considering the size and resolution of the screen. Unless there is an offline mode, multimedia usage is completely pointless. Because the music/video player is probably excellent, but the battery doesn't allow a suffecient amount of use for listening to music, or watching videos. If you're interested in the Iphone, I suggest waiting for the second generation of them to be released. Apple always makes great improvements with the second generation of their technology.
Really cool phone. Watz this people all are commenting on card slot, 3g n' camera. Common guys it has 4 or 8 GB inbuilt memory. n' about 3g, n camera. guyz apple has jus entered into manufacturing phones letz wait for the new models n' see.
It would be gd if it's 3G .Having infared port , walkman and at least 3 MegaPixel(it would be best if 5 Mega Pixel) will boost its popularity . Hope it's possible for them to create a nano phone with all these functions . It definitely can surpass Nokia !
have you ever said a phone is great without having it???
relly a cool fone if it had mem card slot, min 5 mp cam (coz it shud replace digital cam). 3G capabilities is a must.
This phone is a gem.Because of its 3.5" display with 16M colours and intregated ipod music/video it will top the rank. Though it needs a minimum 3.2MP camera with flash & auto focus plus 3G capabilties and a must needed card slot.
Will this phone be able to work on all networks?
4gb-499usd

8gb-599usd
there is always Jaun how can you already have the handset get a life and leave this fro people who have something good to say to me the handset looks good 3G would make it better but apple probably want you to get all the stuff on the phone from there website not elsewhere it seems to be the next steop forward for the ipod

Somebody help me out. Am I missing something? whats so great about this phone? Hell ,I dont even like the looks. With a price tag that would make u double think, u are not even getting a smartphone. I will never go for this phone, unless he price was about 200$. And somebody down the list wanted to buy the 80GB version ,lol. Is that out too?
I wanna buy it it's a gud phone only 1 thing lacking is radio.It shud be included in it den it will rock..... 9/10 but after radio 10/10....
Just buy a f****** digital camera with 7mp and flash. Do you bring your cellphone on vacations so that you can take photos???NOOOOOOOOO.
this phone should have 3g capabilities. minimum 3.2mp camera(plus flash with auto focus.
thats not a phone.. well not sized like one.

i think if i used something that big. people would think im talking into my ipod like im crazy.



aside from that. the features look good though.
comparing 2 nokia other than da touch screen this is not up 2 standered. but i think this is a good atemp. keep it up!!!!!!!
It's not 3G,2MP camera, no card slot? What is this, some kind of fun? Oh please, only design is OK and at first glance looks powerfull, but when I read specifications I think it sucks!
this phone is really great, even i will try to get one for me. i really like this phone...

hope to see more good phone's in future from apple company..man... the phone doesn't have 3G....
i dont know why there is so much hue and cry about 3G, not much people are gonna make good and proper use of it. though the single most important factor of this phone is Mac OS X, if the apple is opening up a way to write custom programs for this baby. its hit among common users and even programmers. the creative possibilities with this phone would be endless.
Havent you learned something with the ipod? its not about 'what it does', its about 'HOW it does it'.... Iphone is gonna win on ease of use.
Lets face it - the UI looks nice but as for being "5 years ahead of everyone?" cmon.



The N95 has GPS, AGPS with built in Maps, WIFI with a browser, 3.6 MM jack, USB 2.0, 5.6 Mpix camera with Carl Zeiss optics, A full ITUT keyboard (all touch is good for USA where people are used to using two hands to text on their blackberrys but in Europe and Asia where people like to sms without even looking it will not do as well). Support for WMA, WMDRM, AAC, eAAC+ (even the N91 had that) - suppport for many music formats not just Fairplay and MP3s (Apple are control freaks that make Microsoft look like Ghandi). 3G, HSDPA, etc etc...



That doesnt seem like Nokia being 5 years behind to me....Jobbs is the great hype artist and the marketing will sell iphones no doubt but let's see if users are willing to accept the fact that dropping their iphone from waist height on concrete ONCE will trash it. (N91, N80 etc were reportedly dropped 300 times on concrete to test the phone...do that with an iphone).



time will tell



pappy
You all can just shut up! So what if no 3g?

Its a great phone. I mean come on!
apple is apparently going rule the cell phone market place with this launch. iPhone has borrowed the genes from hugely successful iPod so far no other manufacturer has been able to enjoy the success rate that iPod has had in the portable music player segment. but sucess in india depends on how competetivly apple prices it. and how well can it set up sales network as that of nokia in india .. iPhone has bit disappointed us with the 2 mega pix camera no 3G support, however the absence of memory card slot is made good by 4/8 gb flash... i think the apple will have to come up with a new version immidiately to please the critics and do away with bit large size....  the  rest of features are awesome.. brilliant.. () FINGURING () input wow .wow





There is a 2mp camera on the iPhone, however, no auto-focus or flash.
actually its pretty decent in size not that big.. ive seen it on tv with some guy holding it at some apple conference..does anyone know if there actually is a camera on this cause ive never seen a rear view of the iphone
i gotta tell ya i dont know, the whole touch screen thing doesnt do it for me , after a while with rain fingerprints scrathes in pockets its gonna be minced out of it, make it hard to watch videos , i can see an expanded ability one coming out very soon after this one, thatl annoy everyone who bought this version
Wow looks pimped but as some guy said how is going to fit in ur hand ? It problay be like walking around with a brick in ur hand but seems pretty good and 3g would be nice

3g please
whoever is that silver fox or whatever need to really look at the N90.  ITS A HUGE, PLASTIC BRICK.  and nothing else.  it has to be more than an inch thick.
sucks!!!!!, no 3g?........ came on apple!!!!!

you cant replace the battery, and not expen. mmemory?!!!!!!, and $600.00 us for a 8.0GB.....
I like it.... Apple Ipod and phone in one box... MMM When you find price... send me mail on mrdeadmail@gmail.com
Hi Folks,

To be smart, there is no 3G, no FM. More over what could be the price of this scooby :D.



Cheers,

newbug
Stupid! Why no 3G!!!!!!!!!!!
.....wew! its kinda expensive en nice
this phone does seem pretty sick ... but i would MUCH rather get the samsung f700 ... it seems wayyyy better

and although the mac commercials seem good ... there soo annoying to use
A lot of people seem to complain about it not having 3G, autofocus, 5 mp camera, or games.



I could almost guarentee that there will be games coming out. It is using OS X for the first time on a mobile phone, which means no one has had time to make games for the iPhone specificly. I give it probably 2 months until widgets will come out with games.



I feel the iPhone will be a great start for apple. I will most likly order it as soon as it comes out. I am excited to use the phone as a touch screen. Also for setting the background, how many phones can you select just part of the picture as you are looking at it? There are quite a nice amount of features.



I am excited!
cant wait. looking forward to demoing the phone to customers, and ACP'ing my current contract, are we any wizer as to who will be supporting this phone in the UK as far as net works go? due to working in phone retail i know who would be best but i shalnt name drop.



i think the induction of OSX will urinate all over Windows Symbian OS's. i have the suss feeling that this is going to ahnialte Nokia over any other brand. again as to the camera comment, a) 2meg aint bad if you think of VGA. b) when this takes off, i shouldnt think it would be long before they expand the range. if you look at Sony, they have the K and the W range, and both are doing exceptional.The touchscreen is actually bigger than 3,5".

I know this by printing out a picture of iPhone

the right size and measurements.

It also fits beautifully in my palm, so all of you saying that is is a brick, are completely wrong!
yes!!! this phone has an OS the best OS for phone Mac OSx(10) its is better that windows xp
EMMMA are u blind u not see slide to unlock???? hmmm that Nokia e90 that's a GReAT!!! phone real nice but.... there is always a but huh? the IPHONE can do everthing the e90 can do plus more

u don't understand when u using the internet with this phone its like u using it on a laptop
alex IPhone technology is 5 years ahead of all phones so just shut up!!
MARC!!! u liar nokia N80 is nothing compared to the apple iphone first of all N80 dosen;t have MULTI- touch input method iphone is the only phone that has that.. Secondly the iphone has the best mp3 player ever made the widescreen ipod with cover flow....if u know what that means.. and it has and advanced photo call plus it has GPRS + Wifi internet and it has the HTML browser the best browser which is Safari and it has and OS MAC osx(10) which is better that windows xp and more okk so when u don't know anything about the iphone just kaiete!!! and it has more features and more and more okkkk..........
This phone will be released in June, 2007.
by the time this phone comes out, its features will be old, iphone way behind. i would buy se p990i instead.
Hi! I Phone i love you so much....! when you arrived...? I wait to buy 1 ...!
will it work in india.? how gud is the battery back up??
i think it'll be a great phone.

Okay there's no 3G, no radio, no HS...(ya you know what i mean), no IR but it comes with Wifi, touch screen (and no one ever made it like apple did), look at it design its great (i can't say awesome because i haven't hold it) but it's great. You'll using OS X than Symbian or Microsoft or Linux. Hwo ever had experience with OS X on your palm (for all apple freak) and for you all beginners this a great oppurtunities to use great OS and the best is it's in your palm. Jobbs maybe stole LG idea but he's not the first one (remember Gates?)...it's all about creativity, idea comes and goes but it depends on who can make it real and works.

Face it. it's a great smartphone. You can't have it all, you have to pay for everything. like SE did with W880.

i can't wait for it.......
The Ipod was not a new invention, there were many MP3 players on the market, what Apple did with the Ipod was genius, they did not put in any new bells and whistles just incorporated great design, quality and innovation and dominated the MP3 market.  Expect Iphone to do the same, it will not have the bells and whistles (like the IPOD) but what it does do, it will do to perfection (or almost) and it will do it in a new innovative way, it will be the best phone, PDA on the market.



But I to feel a bit let down by the lack of 3G and 3MP camera support.
I think this phone is good but i don't know the process on how to download the music.Is it easy to input any kind of data inside this phone?
Forgot to tell you that I can put 410 songs at 128kbps on one CD equaling about 35 CD's per discs x 6.  So that beat's any external device that I know of.  If you are willing to downgrade to 96kbps, you can get another 90 songs, which range from 3-9 minutes each.
Just so you know your Nokia can play 8 different kinds of media songs/tunes, and the far superior WMA at 192kps.   I have an N80 with 40MB of internal memory & 2GB card and it has about 3000 songs on it which connect to my new 2007 Audi S8 via the same connection as an iPod.   So, know I can play WMA and MP3 CD's via the 6-disc changer, I have XM Satellite Radio, and I have FM/AM/external device control which includes any WMA/MP3/AAC, etc., type of device.   There is really no limit.
I really don't see the point.  You could buy an 80 gig ipod (or better yet, a Creative Zen) and get a good Sony Ericsson phone for a lot less.
apple.. plz keep taking care of ipod.. not this stupid phone
awww... copycat of LG PRADA! just after a month prada phone was released, steve jobs came up and announced this copycat phone! Maybe steve jobs wasnt even considering making phones.. just before the prada! but after he saw it, ........you know it
what do you mean it's 3.5g?...it can't be 3.5g if it's not at least 3g.  in all honesty it's 2.75g...which is what EDGE is classified at.  and no...having wifi does not make it 3.5g.
Hi,

All features in Apple iPhone are amazaing, it would be also good to have one with 3G option to make a perfect choice.



At the MAC Worls expo, during Steve Jobs Key note speech where he announced this handset, he did comment that this is the first in a line of handsets to be released and that there are 3G models being developed.

So calm down...Well, ok multitouch means that screen can read more that one input at a time. What if I touch two applications logo simultaneously to launch both. Which one will be launch first?

well whts gud bout dis fone is that,it is the 1st fone which has got 16M colors in a touch screen .thats awesome.rest all fone like o2 n htc give 256k or65 k .i hope i am rit
should have had atleast 3 megs? it comes with at minimum 4 gigs
multi-touch means a touch screen.  The OS is OSX.  All the features are widget applications. Theoretically, that means it will be able to do anything your computer can do given the limitations of internal memory and storage.  Possibilities are truly endless.  This is gonna be one kick ass phone.  I've been with the same carrier for 15 years, but I will probably leave to get this phone.
This phone is a hoax all touch screen is bogus they qwerty is gonna take up like 3/4 of the screen when you pull it up, the N95 is a wicked phone and will blow this out of the water with out question! Only reason this phone will sell is because they are working with cingular. its going to be like the chocolate from LG looks sweet but sucks balls!
you all go on about a phone have more than a 2 or 3 megapixel camera if your that bothered then buy a digital camera thats what they are there for!!

so will you please stop moaning about cameras you all say the same thing ova again and its gettin boring now
I have used P800, Atom, and is now using P525(asus). I can tell you now that P990 is not a smart choice. All it ever has is bad reviews and user complaints. Besides, the camera on P990 isn't great, and symbian 9.1 has little software to offer while P990 cannot install old software due to the classic sony moves to rake more money with licensing powers. Get a windows mobile phone instead.
Can anyone tell me which one is better to get, SE P990 or iPhone? I really like the N93i too only because of the high camera and video quality only its a bit big for a flip phone (and kind of ugly) and a bit expensive (around 700 right?)...but still I have been saving for a new phone and I really want it to be the best I've ever had so does anyone have any recommendations? Also, can this phone record videos (I am guessing it should) and does anyone know in what quality and is there a limit to how long the clip can be? For P990 too...what is the video quality like and allowable length? Thanks
No, you can't read office files. It's not a smartphone.
Its areeally cool phone. but not amazing there are few things missing, ihope apple works on it . it should have had cam flash and at least 3 meg but overall its not a bad phone cant wait

and for all you people out there dont judge just like that. all right "peace"
People that like this phone really need to look around. It has almost none of the features most standard PDA/touch screen phones have. Plus it runs on MAC. You'll be crying when people outside ask you "what programs do you have?" and have to answer "there are almost no programs available for MAC, they are all Windows pocket PC... sigh". Besides, what can you really do with this without a stylus? Everything will be digital buttons here and there so you might as well forget the touchscreen that will be full of greasy finger prints.
achin

multi-touch means that the screen will register more than one finger touching the screen, and will be able to track what they are doing, as apposed to a regular touch-screen which can only sense and track one input at a time.
Can I read a Microsoft excel file (.xlc) or Microsoft word document (.doc) on this mobile phone?

and also Can I open web page through my ADSL connection in my office?

What does Multi Touch Input actually means? Any guesses or views!!!!!
some wicked phone
With all available features, they can't implement flash camera???
it has a 2 megapixel camera everyone
Iphone have Cam

there is one thing i really

need a answer, i thought over and over

Why a phone need a cam goes in it?



I may get a SE w950 first!
you text using the slide out keyboard the screen moves up and the keyboard slides down kinda like the Sidekick 2 or Hiptop 2
n o  c a m e r a!!!!!this phone look awesome. what is the price gonna be? i really want to know. who can tell me? i can't wait to use this phone :D
simple...WOW!!!
hey this phone is flippin sweet!@##@!
very nice phone!8gb vau!
I-Phone  cost eith $500 or $600  depending 4 or 8 gigabyte storage  this is the no contract price.  With a contract with Cingular probably $400 or $300
Phone is too cool!

specially its new touch screen technology
does this phone has bluetooth? think not

and it really looks like a PDA for me. I don
i cant wait for this phone to come out hope its soon!!! good work apple
it is a very nice machine ... but i am disappointed bec it will not be suitable for all applications ... only mac applications

the iphone is

ggggggggrrrreeeeeeeeeeaaaaaatttttttt!!!!
My only big worry is how it is gonna deal with the smudges. The whole phone looks like it is ipod material . Im sure the phone is goin to be amazing but it looks like it can smudge extremely easily.
It seems like too much waisted space that isn't screen, what is the point of this design wise? Also, too much fast food has made this phone a little fat!
I think it sucks that other GSM carriers will not be able to use this phone, I think for a number of reasons. One(1) I have T-Mobile and I F*ckin hate Cingular, T-Mobile won't be able to use this phone "I think" because the way the voice mail is set up. T-Mobile will is not capable to use that feature. I hope they come up out with the same phone for other GSM carriers.
this phone is like a magic!!! 8 pioneer a new sofware and very powerful sensor, u can do anything on the screen thru ur finger. the camera doesnt hav a flash, turn off!!
Hey, Real Madrid, this phone needs the 4 bands. It's guarantees that it'll works around the world. For example, there is some countries that uses 850 mhz band, like my country Venezuela, as well as Colombia, Argentina, some African countries...
I think that this phone will chanche the way that we looks a phone.  Certainly,

ther's on the market a lot of pda-phones-etc., but, HEY! It's APPLE!!!  I'm waitin' for this phone... see ya!
I wonder if the I Phone is quad band because Tri-band phones only work in certain areas - maybe 75% of all areas in the U.S. + if it is tri-band, you can't roam seamlessly across countries and continents...  The I phone's allure is obviously it's hi-res, bright screen (which will attract drunken eyes like moths to a flame in a club or bar) and it's touch screen ( which will make it easy for drunken fingers to text, call, and find those disgusting porn photos to show to everyone.)
god, people are so stupid.



they say stuff about this phone like THEYVE ACTUALLY HELD IT AND MESSED WITH IT, WHICH THEY HAVENT, SINCE IT HASNT EVEN DEBUTED!!!



this phone is a lot better than people say.



its the size of a SLVR! only a little wider



it has wifi and edge



a 2mp camera



multi-touch screen



nokias suck, they are too big and arent as good as everyone say they are



nokias dont have widescreen, multi-touch, or even a screen of comparable size



and who needs a camera better than a 2mp when if youre rich enough to buy this you can get like a 10.1 mp casio exilim ex-z1000 or z1050 or a sony cybershot n2
samsung f700 is what this phone should be.  its perfect.  5mp camera, 7.2 mbs hsdpa and best of all its not made by apple
I am not sure about this phone but i heared it in construction still.

Can you quote the price in Jamaica currentency.

Please...

Thanks In Advancethis phone resembles...nokia 6233...
i love this phone!! but what happen with the touchscreen, i'll get all greasy , and battery is quite low for ones expectations, one will have to carry something to charge it everywhere and a little tissue to clean the screen
"WOW, I LOVE IT, I WAAAAANT IT"



Oh c'mon, give me a break.  Some one said "those phones will sell with a bang" will they really?  For $600 with 2year plan it is crazy expensive...

To Apple Madness: What are you talking about iphone being a smart phone while Nokia serie is not? N93 N93i and N95 are all very smart phone, while iphone can only pretty much look at pretty pictures and watch 1/4 of a movie (due to battery life) and listen to music. Notice I said LOOK at pretty picture because it can TAKE picture for S**T. The N93/i N95 can do all these and yet it has a 3mp 3x optical zoom camera with VGA 30fps video recording VS a 2mp camera on the iphone? I choose a Nokia N-serie anytime even though I am not a Nokia fan, as for your comment with the ipod... that is why I never use one, they are BIG and UGLY and expensive for merely a MP3 player!

This is basically an ipod video... a much BIGGER ipod video, intergrated with a very basic phone. It is absolutely OUT RATED!

You may say that the screen is the reason why it is big, well it is the screen that i dislike the most, I owned a number of PDA and let me tell you, the touchscreen is uncomfortable, unconvinient, and unresponsive (sometimes... when you dont what to press too hard and bread or scratch the screen) I am going back to good old kedpad phones! NEVER AGAIN touchscreen, to hack with the bigger screen.
This is an extremely clever device.Doubters should research the differences between os x and inept operating systems like symbian.
Wait until people use it and keep getting face grease all over it all the time....and one drop and f**cked big time!



This phone is a piece of krap...this is getting rediculous.  A phone should be a phone...who cares about browing pics, music, etc.  Battery technology today can't keep up.  The battery on this thing will blow. Every 15 year old will have one to replace their IPOD until they go to make a call and the friggin thing dies on them!



On another note, this OS is meant to be used two-handed with no keys on it....people will get annoyed when you try to make a one handed call....impossible!...POS!
This is defintely a great phone, good design great mega pixel etc but without a 3G capability...a minus but still a great phone
Yes, It looks nice.  It will most certainly sell with a big bang.  Although, to me it seems a mere upgrade on the LG Chocolate KG 800/KE850.  Hopefully the GSM part of the phone does a good job.
This iPhone is awesome and have the best OS ever made; Mac OS X!



Apple is in 2007 one of the most reliable players on the ICT-market!



I'm using a Macbook Pro since 2 months and I can tell that I don not waste time anymore in creating music and webdesign: it's just a professionnal tool!



iMatt
Sure it looks all fancy with the glossy finish and the huge touch screen and all, but cmon! No 3G? And I can't imagine being able to text very well on a phone without a proper keypad...looks like it's gonna be a big fingerprint magnet too.



Overrated phone...just as much as the ipod itself is overrated...



It needs to have 3G services,and to be able to make Video calls
the best phone in the world, that wil be last phone i have. no more nokia, etc....
Apple has permanently changed the way I look at cell phones on the market today.
well, the best of this phone is the user interface, so how can all of you post an opinion without even using one???? it looks beatiful however using a real phone will tell the truth. the colors of the phone look impresive.  we all love cartoons dont we? can't wait to try one even though owning one will be difficult.
Not special @ all, hardware like this has been on the market since 10-2006
Looks cool............!
I'd wait several years before buying any phone from Apple.



First anyone else can make their interface just like it since Apple can't risk patent war with other mobile makers.  After several years, we've know how Apple's interface has influenced the other mobile makers.



Second Apple just won't have much interesting software for quite some time; heck we're still not sure how open it'll be.  Plus the iPhone is quite short of features.



Third your really paying for that 4gb of flash.  But, if you read gsmarena, you've surely got a big flash chip already!  Keep your money by using your old chip in a new Simbian phone with more features.

If this is not a 3G phone than this phone would be worthless. Jobs if you are reading this Upgrade the phone...
Does any one knows or had any experice of connecting similar devices to an external hard drive ? thanks
The phone is nice, the OS is a decade ahead of windows mobile. From the video clips which i saw and personally a apple computer and ipod video user, there is no lagging at all. For battery life, all the pda phone have almost the same talktime but if used in ipod mode it will last longer. For 3G, who needs 3G in the states? Wi-fi is almost everywhere, the speed is way faster than Malaysia, so the cellphone is constructed based on the American's needs. By the way, Apple and Cisco is joint venturing, everyone is using VoIP(free internet call) rather than paying for the call. Nokia n series is a cellphone, apple is a smart phone, big differences. As for apple have no experience in making cellphone? Think about it. When apple first launch ipod, sony & other mp3 player is way ahead but loss in the competition to apple which has no experience.the only thing that is missing is a second cam for a video call!!!!!when is this phone coming???????i caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnttttttttttÂ­ttttttt wwwwwwaiiiiiiiittttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!1

do u know how much will it cost?(euros)
Relax guys, as i thought its crap. Apple would not allow the device to be affected in that way. They will control whats put on this device, not cingular and not the european providers either, whoever that may be. Internet provision is a key part of the device and apple would ensure its available. Cingular are playing to apples tune, they have already had to sacrifice a lot to even win the contract with them. Internet will be slow outside of wifi spots using edge thats for sure, but i expect the wifi to be excellent. Bring on the 3G version and the european release! Might tempt me away from my money then.
If iPhone does not have wifi, it's just a piece of junk. The reason that I wanted to buy the iPhone was it has better internet communication than other PDA phones. If iPhone does not have wifi, I would buy other PDA phone rather than iPhone with cheaper price.
Ineteresting but the link doesn't work.
Heres the story on the non-wifi movement



"Apple Caves To Cingular iPhone Demands

April 1, 9:13 AM      source: FCC / Apple



Newly spotted FCC documents provide the final details and specs of Apple's iPhone, and it no longer includes Wi-Fi. The iPhone was approved for GSM/EDGE 850 and 1900, and Bluetooth, but the lack of Wi-Fi certification in the FCC pages shows that AT&T (Cingular) may have won a round at the negotiating table with Apple. The user manual submitted to the FCC also shows that Apple's planned set of "widgets" have mostly been replaced with links to Cingular services such as Cingular Video and MEdia Mall. An Apple spokesperson told Phone Scoop that Wi-Fi was dropped to save battery life. The iPhone is already without a 3G data radio. For it to lose Wi-Fi is a major blow to Apple and the device itself. Also, at the recent CTIA show, AT&T revealed initial pricing for the plans associated with the iPhone. A 600-minute plan with unlimited data will run $179.99 per month. An analyst from Yankee Group said that if consumers are "gullible enough to pay $600 for the iPhone then they can afford the high monthly fees."

My information comes from working for Cingular Wireless, it's all about money. The reduction of Wifi being on the launched device means people are stuck using the Edge internet speeds, which inturns means a boost in data plans since people wont be able to have a wifi option and get their own internet to the device. Wireless companies want you to spend money not save.. its bad to say but its the truth lol.
How is wifi closed down? What the hell are these people on about? If you are going to start talking about stuff with cingular can you at least back your opinions up? I have not read one single thing about such limitations on the device and i keep well up on all apple rumours.



The wifi will connect to your home wireless networks or other hotspots around your country? This surely has nothing to do with cingular, you are not paying them for this data received.



If what you are saying is that the internet will be limited outside of wifi areas, then thats fair enough, but it wont be that great anyway due to only edge support. wait for the 3g version which is undoutedly already being worked on by apple. Myself i cant see the phone coming to the UK or Europe for that matter without 3G support. Cingular wont be providing in europe anyway, so this doesnt concern me. Anyone got any idea who will provide in the UK? Orange, o2 or 3 seem the likely candidates to me.



No doubt the phones expensive but if you want this sort of beautiiful interface, with yes, "everything just working" then you can expect to pay a premium. Remember this is an ipod as well guys!
Like to clarify for people thinking this phone is the truth, i hate to break your hearts but it's a waste of money.



I work for cingular, guess what.. no more WiFi!!! And the Special plans for the device are going to start at $179.99/Month. Like the other cingular employee mentioned.



Also the price is $499.99 (4GB) and $599.99 (8GB) THIS is with a 2Year Contract!! If your not elgible to extend your agreent add another $150-175 ontop of those prices to figure out your non-comitment pricing.



I'm very deep with the technical side and data side within Cingular, and like i tell every customer comming into the store asking about the device.. It's a waste of money! In the summer with the launch of the device we will be comming out with a couple new devices with 3G and ability to use a 4GB micro sd... So Better Phones, Cheaper Prices.. Same Music Storage with the 4GB micro sd's coming out..
guess it will "just work" with everything but high speed internet, streaming video, and the same edge thats been around for years.  way to go steve jobs.  keep those fans happy =).  i work for cingular so more data plans and cash for me
HAHAHAHAHAHAAH ty cingular.  Iphone will no longer have wifi hahah best thing ever.  a 2g phone with no wifi.  sorry apple mwhahah.  a lousy phone just got WORSE
Everyone who does not like this phone should keep their opinions to themselves, it is not even out yet! Anyone claiming to have played with it for 20 minutes is talking rubbish, very few have even seen one yet alone played with it. I for one think the phone is great, although living in the UK  means i will have to wait a while longer for it. Combining the ipods features with the bigger screen and phone abilities is the main reason for me purchasing this phone. One less gadget to carry around! Have concerns with the screen but im sure apple would not release a product that could be scratched with a feather, its bound to be very durable, surely more durable then the current video ipod screen. Myself, im probably guna wait for revision 2. This is partly due to being stuck on a current contract, while also wanting to wait for 3G and a 3Mp camera on this phone. 16Gb of memory would not do any harm either! Just my thoughts.
Can't wait!!!! they should sell it sooner!!! =)
"cingular.com" 4gig $499 - 5gig 599... thats before the contract. so it would be around $200 to $250 for the 4 gig.
this is a nice phone. but there are some aspects which which will make it fall short of the revolution it will cause as many predicts. first, it is expensive! if you have a good phone already, is it really worth spending the extra doh (alot too) on this?

two, it is big! although it has great functions, people want a phone that can fit in your pocket without pulling your pants down infront of that hot chick uve been dying to meet.

three, yes yes, i agree, functions are supurb. but havent we all lived relatively well without it?

although i think may kids will bug their parents to get it for them (most being sucessful), i think that we will continue to see the good old brands of samsung, lg, nokia, sony ericsson etc in the majority of pockets around the world.
Why are you guys comparing the iPhone with the likes of n95!!bleeding heck os x makes the iphone a mini pc wheras symbian makes the n95 a bit part smartphone.
this containes every thing a person wants this the best phone for this genration every thing u want ois present in it  ... and u can use it in many ways kkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

the look of the phone is very nice ...... but the thing is that u have to takecare of the screen .the damand of apple will go higher as compare to now. and i think apple will make more phones like this in future because this mobile is gretest of all

...........................bla bla

bla bla .....bla........bla
hi guys, i think you should take into account that this isn't the releasing version. maybe apple is modifying the phone features and even the price. did you hear about that theory of the "mysterious" application? what do you think about it?
the price for the 4gb is 499$ and the 8gb is 599$
i saw this mobile and iam thinking to buy this mobile in 2010. but i have heared its a very good mobile.
it is impossible to unlock if u put it in your bag well because apple is saying that the touch screen only works with your finger and u cant even use a stylus on it so yealove the look of his  phone but dose have a connection where i can conect it up to my car as it has an ipod conection some pls let me kw
It has wi-fi..
Damn! This is the ultimate in mobile world! All things mixed up into one drop dead gorgeous ultra thin phone. Who says thus isn't good enough??? Maybe you should leave earth and stay in mars!!!
Neonode ripoff. Let's hope it does the work a little bit better tho.
this fone roks ....i really want it
This fone won't surely work best in PI. Geez, my NOKIA 3210 is still the best and most reliable fone ever... Cheers!!!
Don't Worry, they are not getting rid of the Wi-Fi, its staying, its a great feature and apple wouldn't even consider removing it. Stop believing romours trust apple.
All who want to know if the iphone has Wi-FI go to this site

http://www.muniwireless.com/ar...cleview/5522
and the iphone is GSM by d way
The Iphone is gonna drop its wifi capabilities when it will be released, check it up on phonescoop there was an article about!
Yes, nice new gadget for in your pocket, sure I want to have this, the faster the better! I likkeeeeee...



Kill some time of your life and show off, there are enough people with that normal phone that does the same but that just doesn't have tha looks!

samyt - GSM? you can't move your eyes 10 cm up the page?
this phone just like shid...wasting your munney to buy an "unfeatured" phone..

nowadays what people need is a full featured phone,not stylish phone...truly said,the iPhone salesmen should have post their advert on "stylish" country such as france,or sumthing..and NOT U.S!

they did a lot of mistakes
to be honest, its just like the ipod really, you pay so much for something that isnt really that good. I have a ZEN however which is fantastic. anyway it is a nice phone and the screen is rather nice and wow it lets you use a background!
Lovely phone yaar....
it's such a kooool phone c'mon you gotta luuuuuv it
this piece of crab even doesn't have a built-in gps antenna. paying so much money just for the interface???? no wifi, no radio, no 3g. i mean come on, even my mom's $50 lg phone does have a 3g. apple is all about an interface look.
I think the first gen of this phone will be bought for its style. People who want 3g or a good camera phone wont buy it. The techheads will start buying when the second version comes out.
At end of the day if you want a phone with wi-fi get a phone with wi-fi. I think this phone will revolutionise the way people use phones. It has new technology other phones dont have at the moment. Sod Wi-fi what if people only want it for multi media ie pictures videos etc? Exactly this is the phone these sort of people will buy!
TO MITA u can't watch the features and see Wi-Fi in it?
i cannot see this phone being cheaper than 300 uk pounds. It will be at least 500 i wreckonIt's gonna come too late .. !!!!
2008 in asia ? Apple u have gone mad why so late if it launched in 2008 in asia then it is going to be biggest apple flop Nokia and others will definately come with some better solution with iphone problem i m not going to wait that long
very nice outlook. Ms Vivien Peh not sellign also...why ahh?
can u put a normal sim card in it
Does anyone know about what is different in bluetooth + EDR and what are the blue devices announced till now ... i lov this phone
well everyone is posting about how low the memory is, but u know, if you compare it with de nokia nseries, this phone has up to more than 6gb than with the nokias nseries. appel is the coolest !!! they do know what they r doing!
heavy?? what r u talking about, look at the phone, it's wort carriing it, it has a nice phone, camara, ipod, and video player. who needs more?? 3p isn't worth having.
135?! Too heavy for me. I don`t like to carry a brick on my pockets...
Any one have this phone yet? so much news for nothing! I wonder if the phone any good- make by brand which never made any phone before. I have so much wasting time with the ipod and now they make a phone will never able to make or receive any call- Good Luck to who ever going buy it!
" This phone is looking to be the best phone of current time. And as we know from Apple the next generation will just get better."



Yep...this the phone that i really want...
for mac lover's .. it rulesz..but for new users who r used to the lame windowss software .. it'll be difficult .. but worth it!... free of virus'zzzz... lovee it. n m 100% gona pik 1 up!
Seriously who really cares if it doesnt have 3G. I have a 3G phone now and i never video call, or use any of its capabilities. Plus don't ever use an FM radio either, i just put some Mp3 tunes and prefer them. Seriously look at the pro of it having Mac OSX 10!!!! and yes it does have Wi-Fi. And Oh No, it doesnt have a 3MP camera...oh well, ill just take my digital camera which is 6MP with me if im that desperate to get a good photo. This phone is looking to be the best phone of current time. And as we know from Apple the next generation will just get better.
Itï¿½s stoned phone compared to latests nokia phones
wow its not as good as everyone said it is afterall...no 3G--and theres no way Apple is guna make it 3G. Face the truth--north america is in the stone age of mobile phone technology. Camera 2.0mp--im thinking by the time its out for the public, brands like Nokia will already have 3.2 mp for their default phones.
3p ? who needs it??? wifi is everywhere, and if u dont havet at home, poor u, wifi is a lot faster if u have a good conection and cheaper. iphone is the best of the newest gadgets.
for more info, watch the Keynotes Video on apples web site under iphone, then see why some things are left out for the items that are included, OSX 10 built-in, need i say more





http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/mwsf07/


iphone introduction,it's long, but the first half tells you how to use the thing



proud mac user
For the last time...



Wifi will be present on this phone. End of. Finish. Move on. I have googled it and cant find anything, plus i track apple rumours and not a sniff of any news of this sort. This rumour must have started as an april fool i am sure. Please stop bringing it up people! If you have found info then show us a link, or stop repeating yourselfs. Its boring. Apple wouldnt hamper the phone by allowing cingular to take away wifi, thats just not apple. Wifi is a clearly advertised feature on the apple website.



This is a first generation phone, memory wll be improved as flash memory increases (a 16gb is on the cards for sure), camera will improve in future generations, 3g will defo be present in future generations and i would guess straight away when it comes to europe. Dont be suprised to also see future smaller iphones, following the ipod nano and shuffle trends.



And to people questioning its ipod abilities, it plays video, podcasts, music, ebooks, everything a normal ipod does. Syncs with iTunes like every other ipod. Im waiting for a 3g version and hopefully a larger memory before i buy, so i can store more video and music.



Just my thoughts.
still its a sick phone!!
not 3g!!! too bad for iphone and it seems too expensive..
It's gonna get scratched just like every ipod.
is it comming out in south africa it looks great
While most comments here are about it's cam or the size or the browser or the price i think the most promising thing we should really care about is the operating system.Mac always deliver a far better stable operating system for PC than Microsoft.If it did it again with mobiles it may be the best step in the smart phones area and the final solution to all the stubid and slow performance by Symbian.A Smart phone that's really Smart !!That's what i hope to find in IPhone.Better Cam,The 3G version.....etc will come sooner or later and after all not all users are intersted in that.If there's anything we should ask more than a Stable operating system then it will be surely the price !!
god this is the fone iv bin waitin for just hope it duznt cost a fortune
Just something to add. This phone has never been delayed, its release date has always been June or around there, with end of year estimates for Europe. The only thing delayed has been Apple macs operating system by a few months, as resources are being prioritised on getting the iPhone out on time.



I will definitely want a 3g version, so as soon as thats out i will buy. It is crucial that apple give this to a UK provider that can give good internet packages for 3G, as this is a 3rd of its proposed uses (alongside the phone and ipod functionality). Although it can hook up on a home wifi network and country hotspots, 3g speeds will allow better mobile internet access. Hope vodaphone either raise their game to supply this or it goes sumwhere else.

the presentation movie of iPhone (1:20 hour at 120mb,good quality)
boo, no fm radio, no flash, no infra red. No one uses infra red anymore, its out-dated thats why bluetooth is around. FM radio meh, its an ipod your own choice of music. Flash in camera well no compony is really making leaps in bounds in that area but night mode will do its job for now. I think its pretty awesome, ill buy one after the first batch are out.
ï¿½250 is alot to pay, and will most probably be that price in the uk on an 18 month contract!



I'm on Vodafone and they are ok, the biggest problem with Vodafone was when the Carphone Warehouse were selling their phones, when I got my contract from there they completely miss-sold my contract to me, when I went to complain to Vodafone they were just like "not our problem any more talk to the carphone warehouse" that was annoying.



If it's on vodafone I doubt that many people will ever use 3G even if the phone supports it, currently Vodafone don't offer any 3G packages like free minutes and the price for 3G data minutes are an astonishing ï¿½2.50 per MB!
dont touch screen phones get broken easily..and it's so hard and expensive to replace....
cant wait for this to come out, i get 50% off, God do i love my job
despite the lack of 3G, GPS etc, this phone will be a hit because its an Apple and a ton of other cool features! People have a lot of trust in Apple, don't forget that, but at the same time it has to be reliable and Apple has to deliver their promise to the world, i think Apple knows this and that's why its being delayed. And ones Apple makes some dough from this experiment you'll see the real iPhone II in year that will knock everyone's socks off! Apple is a very serious and innovative company, they don't make junk, or at least that's their reputation, and in my view reputation carries a lot of weight on consumers mind when making a decision to purchase something like this. I would even go as far as claim that there will be a substaintial amount of people out there who will buy this phone just because its Apple who normally would have never bought a smartphone.



This will be interesting to see how consumers will react at launch date.



I admit that many websites might not be easy to use on the iphone, but the option to look at the websites as you look at them on your computer is way better then current mobile phone website dumbed down formats, at least as i have used. Dont underestimate the ease to zoom on websites using multitouch on this phone. You ever used a Wii on an internet browser, to zoom in on websites? Once you get used to it its not so hard, and this is easier. Remember this is not a laptop replacement. Touching with your fingers under multitouch seems on paper a better option then any stylus system i have used on any device. We shall see.



Im sorry, i do not have much experience with smartphones, but i am not sure that this should be lumped as smartphone as i understand it. Ultimately, this phone can go on the internet with email, is an easy to use phone and also is an ipod nano with video capabilities? Cant smartphones do a lot more?  Office and pdf opening seems to be high on that list, and im not sure this can do these things. Maybe such functionality will come in the future, or be announced later.



I can see that you are from the US, but in the UK if you were dropping the equivelant of 250 pound on a phone WITH contract, with no discount, that is crazyness. It will need die hard support for people to pay that. Hoping this will at least fall below the 200 pound mark but im not hopeful. Suppose you have to think you are getting a fully functional and argueably the best ipod on the market along with the phone.



I hope when it comes to europe it wont be vodaphone. Not encouraged by many peoples experience with them or indeed the  signal reception. Anyone got any opinions on vodaphone in the UK to support them?

Vodafone is likely to be the carrier in the UK and Europe. The phone is more than likely to develop 3G either in the 1st or 2nd generation iPhones. Who gives a crap about the quality of the camera. I own a Nokia N93 the main reason I got it was for the camera... do I use it? No! Because the novelty factor wore off! No phone is comparable to a Digi Camera or Digi SLR. The only thing mobile phone camera are actually useful for are for taking pics down the water hole or on a night out. Even then people are constantly moving around, the lightings bad even with u're flash and you get a load of drunk blury photos that you'll delete!



A phone is a phone, a computer is a computer if u mix em up and u want a pocket computer phone which looks pretty damn good, with features that you'd love then go for it. If you're a mac basher then you know what to do with your self, being so closed minded and locked in is very sad and I feel for ya.



There are plenty of FREE apps for OSX that look pretty damn professional compared to similar Windows apps and there are plenty of paid for Windows apps that are better than their OSX counterparts!



Chances are Apple would have developed some kind of intuitive finger clicking thing that will work out what you actually meant to click on... either that or you could just zoom in on the link and click on it! They're not that stupid.



Remember that's $500 plus a 2 year contract in the US!
Response to you as well. Can you seriously imagine browsing this exact page with the iphone? Imagine it is on the iphone screen and you want to click on "philips" on the left. Are you sure that the internet will really win everything? I don't know about you but clicking on it with a stylus is far easier than a finger.



And you say $500 is expensive? No it is not for this type of phone with all the capabilities. This phone's function is meant to be compared to windows mobile and symbian phones. Are you sure you know what you mean when you talk about expensive phones? I have used both symbian and windows mobile, how about you? If you say $500 is expensive, you obviously have not used a real smartphone before because they can double the price of this phone.
In response to previous comment-



Driving - you shouldnt be looking at the phone regardless. Writing off a phone for its ability to use in a car is madness and makes me a little angry. Anthing distracts you from driving, even bluetooth headsets. If you want it this this phone will get you to your caller in no less then 3 button presses anyway. If your thinking about ringing someone, your already distracted. May as well go whole way and look at the screen for a split second. Hope you dont kill anyone.



Internet- plenty want internet on phone. catch up on news, sports etc. This screen is huge and with fully functioning browser will be better then anything currently on market.



Music browsing - dont get what your on about. Its same in content as ipod with slightly changed functionality (ie no clickwheel). Whatever your point is... ipod sell well enough, im sure this will be fine on music front!



Application freedom - "like real macs no desirable applications". Well that made me laugh. Macs have an amazing community, with applications for everything a pc would have. There are less choices but they are easily better in quality more often then not. Never once found me wanting an aplication for a pc that my mac could not do anyway. Have you even tried a Mac? If you have you gave up on it to quickly if you have that opinion. As for iphone, apple will control everything and it will all be excellent as a result, few bugs, crashes etc. If its demanded enough and within reason, i have confidence apple will get it.



Camera- i would like an increase to 3mg but really guys, if you want flash photography by a digi cam! i have a k800 and i still use a digi cam over it. Fine for the odd shot, not a lot more. Even 5 meg on a phone is poor compared to actual cameras nowdays.



Photos - so your critiscising the iphone for having the OPTION to view your most cherished pictures and family pictures???? Right, ok.... cant please everyone....



Video content - If you buy from itunes, its seemless. If you dont (and i dont) then do a bit of research, you will have mastered video conversion very quickly. there are a zillion programs out there that do it for you, especially for a mac.



Comparing this to a PSP is daft. PSP is a handheld games console, this is a phone/music player.



Not having a go at ya, but give stuff a little thought. And btw the last thing thats good about it is the price, this is one expensive phone.







Things look flashy and great but seriously think about it. All the flashy features won't be worthwhile. The only good thing about this phone is it's price. It's 500 US and that is cheap for this type of phone.



Dialing: You can NOT one hand dial with this phone when you are driving because there are no buttons.

Internet: You really want to browse the internet with small text and a huge finger? How can you pinpoint anything?

Keyboard: Sure there is a virtual one, but your finger is huge and you have no stylus to pinpoint what you want.

Music browsing: It doesn't make sense??? Who would have MP3's that are official with all the tags and information to place in the phone?? If you have the official thing it would be in CD format. Not to mention this will obviously not support foreign language songs.

Application freedom: There are about 25000 apps for windows mobile right now. That is a huge market. Sure you can develop apps for this phone as well but you don't know if it will have a license lock like symbian OR if it will be like a real Mac, no desirable applications.

Camera: You get it on every phone anyways.

Picture view and zoom: Like you will really look at pictures all the time.

Videos: You don't need me to tell you by now. Converting or sending it to your phone will turn you off for this feature.



There are a lot more flashy things for this phone but it will end up being a PSP. A phone with many features but none of them worthwhile.
i think presentation for this phone is very exciting but i think the missing things such as 3g ,flash, fm radio ,or if resolution is good then camera should be of more megapixels . such things can effect iphones market , but if u still love apple iphine then dont wait buy it
The Apple iPhone is the best phone in the world and i am sure! when come the iphone sure i was get it!

Also why no infra red? I could use it as a TV remote! :)



.-.-.
its very important to increase camera resolution more to be a complete multi media device
It will be great if iphone can be synchronized with microsoft outlook or Win OS.
if this fone is coming to the european market on vodafone network apple may have to consider making a second type and this time without EDGE and withe 3G video calling
this fone is gr8 it has evrythin excpt radio if it hd tht it wuld b the bst but its stll sick
if it works as well as their ipods this will sell like hot cakes!
it is very best, but is not reconcall and Fm
commenting on this phone would  be silly because actually it hasn't been actually used by anyone here,o2 phone has all hell sort of features but still its crap because of its speed,hanging periodically,by the way phone is only meant for listening &answering the call,the phone can only be best when it passes thru all sort of imp functions like crystal clear voice production very minimal call dropping better cell network reception and the most imp thing the BATTERY LIFE
Awesome O.O it looks great
why complain about the size when most cell phone dimesions are more or less the same, 8gig is a lot of space more than enough for numbers, music and phonto's. As for the memory   Well done to apple, this will probably be a bigger hit than any phone currently on the market
they 've said that it will have 3G when it comes out in Europe!

And only 2 million megapixels? There aren't that much smartphones that have more! Look at HTC for example!

And things like gps will come out later! I am sure of it!

That the big advantage of the touch screen and they say it in the keynote! When you have a good idea after the phone came out, it is possible to download it and the right buttons will be available! With fixed buttons, it is not possible because you don't have the buttons for it!

It is just because it is Apple that there are so much critics!

I like this phone a lot, only the size could be better! A little to big!
I agree, it needs more features like 3G etc!
yahoooooooooo, my dream phone made by apple thank you
They have made a great device but it lacks the fundamental features people ae looking for in PHONES nowadays. 3G, RDS Radio, Expandable memory, what use is Google Maps without GPS functionality? no A2DP bluetooth? only 2MP camera? no document viewer? Nice device but it lacks so much that could make it the best. Hopefully apple will add some stuff before the UK launch.
Brilliant for a "Phone".  How ever if you need to know what features this device harbors, just purchase a Mac!  It's basically the same thing.  As far as an expandalbe slot, there is no need for one if it's boasting a video iPod.  iPhones are packing 4gb for $499.00 and 5gb for $599.00 fresh out the box.  It runs MAC OS X 10.4.8???  I doubt that.  It'll probably be the first out of the Apple family to be running the new Leopard Operating system or have it bundled in the packaging.  Safari is the web browser an...  Hey just go to the Apple site and read people!!
This phone is same like that phone..seriously same..
camera or memory is discontent
With the new 16GB NAND memory chips, we might see the second version with 16GB memory. Iphone has a lot of ways open for improvement for next generations. If the rumor is true, I heard that the battery could be split into two separations. One for phone and one for entertainment so that you don't play so much music that you drain your battery and end up not being able to make calls.
This is going to be the best phone. Even Microsoft CEO is scared of it so he keeps making nasty comments on how it will fail. I foresee what happened to iPod happening again (taking over). Everyone including microsoft keeps copying others. Only apple sat down and thought- How can I make the phone feel more natural? That is how they came up with the interface (flick, pinch and rotatate and so on....) The iphone is not perfect but for afirst generation I can say its way better than Windows mobile on its 6th generation.
this is a phone with a greate storage capacity 4/8 gb memory ,is not other phone in the world who haves this amount of space ,why do spmebody things that this phone need a card slot?

i don,t have one personaly but i thing doesn,t need a card slot
wow how cool is this phone i wanted w580 on se but now im unsure. Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!! wat2do? wat2do?
To be precise,Apple iPhone is the best n stylish mobile i have eva come across,wit it's compatibility,design n feature,am sure it's gonna make super sales when it lands.
hey apple u have made a fantastic phone its sexy i have boghut it today only n this phone rocks no other phone can beat this class phone
hmm i lyk very thing ant apple's iphone..so...only thing i want to knw..is...iphone's external speakers....i wanna knw tht i has external speakers r not...can anyone help to find tht.....
what i find intersting is that none of the people posting comments on this wall actually HAVE an iphone since it hasn't been released yet. i say stop all the speculative criticisms and praises and wait for the phone to come out first!
I've been using Mac products in my work since the introduction of the Mac Plus..One thing that I know I can rely on is reliability....I think that you may be in for a pleasent suprise!
i'll make it short and easy to understand...

apple with changes things the way we seet now, just like the ipod(who would new, the ipod could become a great hit all over the world?).
you people should see it this way, what happen with de ipod? many dislike it cause they said the didnt need so much memory for an mp3, and now look at is is a best seller all over the world, apple has such a good desing and funcionality. all of u should think more about this phone, cause is gonna change the market
im sure u just cant afford it right!?? lol jk comon this phone rox!
im sorry dum sum lover girl i guess wat you say does matter nd btw i still think apple i phone is amazing
hmm apple.... have a laptop

like the graphics... the programs tomuch money for it... phone not so much i dont know what u see on the phone or what it have...but if u buy it u get scrued ..lol

like to pay for programs from apple go a had...lol

will see how u like it then

i stick with ppc more programs and better cpu speeds

apple iphone no bati removeble... thats sucks once your bati go's good by apple i phone...lol plus try the iphone on  your pc computer u cant really do much can u..lol

if u dont have a apple pc the i dont know what u guys gonna do... pay by the gprs or edge if it have one i know u can go by wifi - but come on safary dont support a lot of thinks same like on the imac or macbook and if its lock't then u can't really do nothing

i like this phone the first time but not anymore....and i think i rather buy HTC Shift with win vista  then the apple
This phone doesn't look that amazing. It's not a Nokia so it won't have software faults. But its the size of a P990I, the size is hardly an IPod. Considering they haven't made many touch sensative phones means- i bet they will have problems. Like LG (with the Chocolate, but they have now mastered it with thier Prada) which is the only competitor on the market and a very good, reliable phone. Apple have shot over the mark here- built something up, that when it finally comes out it won't even be that technilogically advanced.
well there is something obvious here and that is : do you remember the first phone nokia brought up to the market !?

ok well this is the first apple came up with !
thx for link kav - amazing item, and can't wait for the launch.

The price is anaunced to be 499$ for 4GB model and 599$ for 8GB model.

I guess that is the retail price without any binding and subscribe inkluded...

Coming June in US and 4Q 2007 in Europe and early 2008 in Asia..

Greetings 2M
gooooooooooooooood
The iPhone is 1st of many to come. Apple once had the best PDA's on the market that were way too advanced at the time (Newtons). They are perfectionists which is great. They are pushing the design boundaries and I will definately get one of these phones.
i think apple should just give up selling phones ... they should just stink to sellin their best items ipod and mac pc's... look apple has onli produce 1 phone and somemore is gonna release the fones very late.... and somemore competitors like nokia and sony... they are very fast ahead....by the time this phone comes out....i think nokia and sony will produce a better 1... to me this phone is good but very very poor in production...

oficial iPhone presentation movie (120mb,1:20hour at good quality)
Cant wait to see this phone........
i would like to coment about colors.. maybe you should have colors for teens.. not only black.. its seems to me that alwalys black color when it comes to phones.. why add something new.. colors that will fit in to the life style of teens.. i'm sure it will sell more.......specialy us! teens.. we've been waiting for that..this devices does syncs with xp & vista regarding the device it's a good one rather far more faster than windows mobile and the os is quite stable and revolutionary kinda device.
dont think all of you understand the iphone as i said before i was able to hold one of these at the macworld show in january for 2-3 mins there is no lagging in going from one application to another it seameless and so quick i dont even think it could be measured applications in some phones take forever take the n95 for eg 3seconds to open the camera application windows is just okay but you neeed to understand is how apple and steve jobs function perfection is all they seek .
you cant compare this wif nokia n80 or n95...both phones hav their own uniqueness...for example n95, a 5mp camera...iphone touchscreen...and hav u read some of the reviews regarding iphone...it seems when u turn the phone horizontally or vertically..the screen follows...and don't forget the worlds best mp3 player is apple ipod...so the sound quality here mostlikely will be better then many other phones...
I have been through many brand of cell phones e.g. "SE p800, p900, p910i, p990i, nokia n90, imate jasjar" etc.

and finally the most friendly and useful "GUI" for a phone...nice job Apple!!! it got to be Apple to do things right. now a lot of copy cats will follow.
i need to know,this wonderfull phone,run the videos of youtube and google videos
I think they took long time to release it , ï¿½t's gonna be out dated , now sony P1 seems to be more interesting than Iphone..
Oh my god this phone itï¿½s aaaaaaaaaaamaaaaaaaazzzzzzinnnnnggggg! i wanna buy it right now!
For such a big screen resolution is very poor. Picture gonna be too grainy
i saw a video on the iphone, n i must say the response of the touchscreen is rrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaalllllyyy good. as in superb. but the f700 certainly is more impressive when it comes to specs. n its pretty too. so far samsung makes really reliable phones. im still torn, but im leaning towards the f700.this thing looks ssoooo fragile. n e fact that when it comes out the whole world would be after it. which makes me so unspecial. but anyways, apple did a fine job on this one and both iphone n e f700 are definitely better than lg prada, which sucks like hell.
People who cannot afford this phone, they just compare this with other brand phones features, design & price..., then say that iPhone is ugly....!
I don't buy this one, I will wait for his next gen, without bugs, more and better functions.
this phone is what i needed it has in built sensors, a touch screen i pod , google maps ,visual voice mail ,very high technology ,2mp cam and so more.but the drawbacks are it dosent support 3g and dosent support external softwares
i love this one more than anyother phone,unique style. Apple's new i-phone indeed a tremendous one,like i-pod.moreover it has a Wi-Fi device which altogether with its exclusive features would emerge as a No.1 in market leaving behind our old Nokia series,even N..
only i can say it's perfect.as soon as it releases i will get one.
i like this phone. nobody can say any thing bad about this phone.



thank you
iphone is where phones are headed in the near future
This is the best Smart phone ever launched....who hates its design is sick because they can not afford it.



Thanks Apple!!!!  Hit the spot!!!
Its a All In One. I definately need one like this. And all apple products are very stable and dont crash and I DONT feel like throwing them out of the WINDOW! . Hence Bravo Long live apple and I am sure this is going to be a huge success.
this phone is really cool. look at what is does!! no other phone in the U.S is like this, unless some other company trys to make a phone like this. i cant wait for this cell ot come out. im getting the 8gig. i got the 2nd generation nano in black so when i get the iphone. its like basically having another ipod!!!  :D
to sumit&others,

3G / HSDPA will be available on this phone in the US sometime this year, not at launch... there will be a firmware update before November.. at that time, this will be the GOD of all phones
the screen is so sweet that fingerprints are barely visible on it! a quick wipe with your shirt and off it goes! wow! apple rocks!!!
this phone is the motherfuqin shiznat! I'm getting it the first day it comes out you queerz! N95 looks like a cheap plastic toy compared to the beautiful iphone! oh joy!!!!!
what is so good about the i-phone?is it just the touchscreen? sony ericcson p990 or nokia e61i..dont these have almost the same features as  the i-phone..please help me out..by answering my question..because i need to buy a good phone by the 25th of may.which phone will be the best for me?..it shouldnt be very expensive
iPhone presentation here:



http://events.apple.com.edgesu...d52oo/event/
the presentation of iPhone - Steve Jobs
im cooooooooooooooooooool
lolz, seem like some of you guys are lacking of knowledge about what is going on with iPhone. There is a guy who is asking about when will Apple release the sale of iPhone. lolz, Guy!
is it just me, or this phone really looks like Benq-Siemens concept phones, The Blackbox and The Ruby?

I agree Nokia fans with no understanding of what multitouch scrren technology means should keep of this thread. The LG Prada and Samsung F700 too are non-multitouch, so can't pretend to even be compared to the iPhone.

The only future contender could be Nokia if they go on with their Aeon concept, which is a replicate of Synaptic's Onyx project.

And yes, definitely this is the new coming wave in mobile communication. It's been too long Nokia doesn't invent anything new.
3G is only used for video phone anyway and i dont even use it as its far to high of cost to do so and not only that some parts of the uk dont even have 3G transmitters so if you want to make lots of video calls then this phone is not for you. I just dont need 3G its  ot the end of the world
I wish Nokia enthusiasts would only comment on subjects they understand!Symbian os is ok for smartphones but we are talking about a device that is on a different level.Mac osx offers far more than symbian ever could.If your looking for a cell that has a dubious 5mp camera then apple is not for you!Want a mini computing device with a proper os,yes?buy an iphone.
There's no way Apple announces a non-3G version for Europe.



The reason why the American version doesn't have it is because GSM 3G in America is incomplete and worthless for many.



This is the opposite for Europe and Apple would've known this through their research.



"January 2008" comes from all of those speculation sites.  I say the 3G iPhone hits Europe before the holidays this year.



Then again you have the Prada phone without 3G so they might feel they can get away with it.
Phone will be available to the us market on june 12 thourgh Cingular.
Omg, this was the biggest phone I have ever seen. Bigger than the black mans weener...
I still can't believe that Apple have yet to announce a UMTS version for the REST OF THE WORLD! So very sad, but I guess the only thing going for it at this price was its design.



I think the SE P1 is probabely going to be a much better choice... as its about the same size and has the features.
yeah I guess some of you guys make sense about the touchscreen. Without a stylus to use, it's gonna be loaded with fingerprints, oil and scratches if it's also not scratchproof. Yeah putting on a screen protector could be an option but it'll probably spoil the viewing experience of such a brilliant display. Definitely a point to consider...
Whats up with you people, comparing this to a nokia? If you want a nokia go to the nokia forums and talk about them there, this is a completely different line of phone and much more superior, Nokias only good handsets are the N series and they all crash and keep freezing after 2 or 3 months and you have to keep updating the firmware for them to keep working, If you like this buy it, Great phone and brilliant OS,,

i think it is better den someother models.......i wanna 2 catch it.god help that child that said no symbian!!!! the best thing about the iPhone is Apple's OS X software retard...why would u would want symbian?
This is over-hyped rubbish. I love my iPod nano but this isn't going to be the superphone that everyone is saying, it will do a lot of things, but none of them very well.
Fantastic, Wonderful, Pretty, Cool, Lovely & ... Phone ...
>> it dosen't use symbian so it's not nearly as good as any nokia s60



it doesn't use symbian, so it's much more better than any nokia
From what I've heard it will be sold in the States for $499 from end of July (IIRC).
Just announced and slept....!!
i think ipods and iphone

is way to chunky

its like a brick in  your pocket

thin or not... 3.5 inches!

thats like huge!!

its sleek looking but i doubt

its durable, and doesnt loook

that great, could be better
Great phone, but waaay too expencive for europe. expected price around 600 GBP(1200$) !!!
This phone is too beautiful but as everyone has said, this is much costly. Apple has to consider its price seriously.
it dosen't use symbian so it's not nearly as good as any nokia s60
This is one cool phone. I can say its way better than nokia or motorola(which is top in the market). I mean in technology. Anyway, the next moment im going to make my account empty if i would want to purchase this phone. That would be crazy isn't it? lol.
Ladies & Gentle man. this phone will be a hit for every one who are 'early adapters'. The price is too high for a mobile phone. Wait until the price gets low as of the other ones in the Market right now. But The price is worth for this as there are many new functions in this one. like the new touch UI (Multi touch). Do any one knows the correct  releasing date. I'm from maldives. Should i wait for this one until launch?
Zomgggzzzz 8 MP cameraaaaaa!!!!
iPhone. Whats so revolutionary about it....I see no point in spending hundrends of dollars on this phone. Sure it got some nice looks and its a great phone to show off with...BUT...the price..haha not worth it. Go find some better phone to use, that has better speakers and is much cheaper than this phone.
Im rahman diba living in iran , this mobile is very very very hot & good !

I like this but this is rich for me !
Its very interesting phone and we need to release this phone with good features and also cheaper prices.we are in Asia, so we need early release for Asia.
the phone will have 3g in europe and i'm gonna buy it like in a year when it's more advanced and will price could go down too...and for those ppl who want a memory slot..U ARE DUMB!it has ver y big memory on it! :D i'm sooo gonna get iiiiitttt! :D :D :D
it's a 3.5 inch phone.even thin. but is over size .you need a hand bag to carry.otherwise will break your pant pocket. think about it?
It's a awsomeee fone! check the introduction!

http://events.apple.com.edgesu...d52oo/event/
after u watch it u'll fall in love with it!

it's soooo cool and it looks great! I'M GETTING IT WHEN IT COMES OUT IN EUROPE!

i mean come on...think how good the iPod is!The iPhone is sooo much better even! it has a iPod in it and u can watch moviess!

and for those ppl criticizin it...DON'T! it's not even out yet so, i don't think u have a right to.! the camera on it is really good!

even tho it's only 2mp..it's really a good camera! soooo gettin it!
Very stylish but still N95 is better.WHAT! No 3G!

no thanks I will not buy it T_T (I was getting this mobile, but I was like @@! when I saw that it dosen't have 3G)
Its a lovely phone,with great features.Can any one know weather it has Bluetooth with A2DP processor for listening wire free music...
Can anyone explain me on what depends that a cellphone works in one country before than others? The "unlocked" term will not work for the iPhone?

I'm from Southamerica (Chile), and we'll have to wait until end 2008.......quite a lot, so I'll apprecite if you could explain me if there's no chance for me to get an iPhone before 2008.

Thanks!!
Can`t you Apple take at least 10g off?

Over 120 a phone becomes too heavy...



PLEASEEEEEE
I think it's a nice phone and all but to all the texters out there, this phone will definately take some getting used to.

I text alot and when I had a touchscreen phone with no keypad, you literally need two hands and great precision to text on the go and not to mention your full attention (ie. when driving lol).
you people must think you get this phone free on contract, nope from 75 on above, for you chavs you wont pass a credit check for it, so you lot can buy a moto f3   19.99
Looks quite nice (the unlock function looks really innovative) and I like features like a standard headphone jack, but a 2mp camera is poor for what will be a high end phone with a massive price tag, and the lack of 3G, memory card slot and IRDA are all negatives. Touch screens are also problematic and fingerprint magnets- this phone looks like style over substance. It'll be interesting to have a play with, but I'm definitely not crazy about it and wouldn't use it as my mobile.
Agree...this phone will be trendsetter in the future like Mr. Steve Jobs said "every once in a while we need a revolutionary product". This will wide open other phone manufacturer "eyes" on how to make real phone based on consumer needs not just some lousy phone we've been used all this time.



For those who thinks this is a "toy" well congratulation to u, be my guest if u buy this toy for your child but only if u can afford it Dudeee.... That thought only represent how narrow ur knowledge bout mobile technology....
This phone is not a 'toy'. It is setting a precedent for the future technology all phones will come to use.



Apple are leading the way with innovation into a tierd and saturated phone market. Nokia N95 offering GPS is a very slow move and obvious one. Not to discredit Nokia, but the next generation of phones needed to turn heads.



I will certainly be going for the I-phone for asthetics and functionality.
Release date - JUNE (USA)



Europe - SEP



Two versions therefore two prices - Memory related.



Just a toy.

I'm concidering to buy this to my 5 year old son. So he can play with this when he's taking a bath and so....but as an cell for me (never this toy, I have N95), To my wife (never to her neither, she have SE).

We are talking about cell phones not toys.
not unlikely in US version but wait till Asia (somewhere in 2008) n Europe (end 2007)



Better save your money now  to get  outstanding phone.
will it support Arabic? arabic SMS?
Here are the ads on the official Apple site. Up to HD quality.





http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/
plese if one can tell me if this phone can type,recieve and send arabic sms.
Best phone ever, why :

1. Friendly and fresh new look user Interface

2. Really cool design (compare to nokia and

SE, other Window phone)

3. Easy to use

4. Great experience in navigation

5. Apple reputation for its stability ((unlike window)



Other than that i dont hv prob with only 2mp camera, no 3g... do u guys actually believe phone camera can match digital camera? Come on guys,  how many of u use their phone camera to take great view in their vacation and put it in frame? And how many of you really enjoy surfing, video conference and browsing using 3g? I dont think so, so for me 2mp considered enough( even if u buy samsung phone with 7mp, i can assure u it still no match with 5mp digital camera from sony, panasonic, or olympus)..



In the mean pls enjoy excitement of the upcoming apple iphone and dont listen to the people who doesnt know anything about mobile phone (Nokia N user, and SE user or Window Mobile user)
Here are the 3 new iPhone commercials showing the June 29th date on YouTube:

They started airing tonight on american television.
This phone will rock. I mean, its beautiful, amazing and innovative features, and its a great music player too! But the key to its success are 2 things: Its and Apple product and the marketing from Apple. to us, geeky people, it might not seem so great copmared to others, but in the eyes of the common, non-techy people, it goes all the way to the sky....XD
Guys just want to ask if we can used it already here in asia?thank you so much.
Release date june 29th....can't waitWhat Apple trying to sell is an IPod with a phone. The rest is extra. Is it worth $600? You be the judge.
There is not a single difference between the iPhone AT&T stores sell and the iPhone Apple stores sell.



They are all as one, work on the same terms.



We won't know of locking manuevers until it is released.  Everything you hear of iPhone lock thus far is pure rumor.  No word has come from Apple.
Does anybody know if the iphone will be sold locked even from the Apple stores?Apple stores will sell the iphone with Cingular contracts obligatorily?...I just want to buy the phone from New York as i will be there for vacation, and use it in Greece...Impossible?Please give me an answer

dude this is the best phone ever look at the touchscreen its the best
How ridiculous. I have nothing more to say - there is nothing more that can be said. Only fools will be buying this especially the first round. Look at the ipod for problems!!! They still havent mastered that so they moved on to something else. Funny thing is - apple fans will follow regardless of quality or productiveness I am an apple fan but only of my apple laptop so its not that Im anti apple, Im just anti "things that dont work properly aka ipod"
Does anybody know if the iphone will be sold locked even from the Apple stores?Apple stores will sell the iphone with Cingular contracts obligatorily?...I just want to buy the phone from New York as i will be there for vacation, and use it in Greece...Impossible?Please give me an answer



I'd like to answer xtremelycomplex's questions which might be other people'questions also.



1. Will iPhone have java games? - Chances are it won't. Initially Apple did not want anyone but them to install games or applications since a lot of them result to system crashes but they are now playing with the idea of allowing other developers work with them, maybe under their monitoring.

2. What are the ringtone options? - Same as all other cell phones, also available to buy on itunes. (there will be a tab specifically for ringtones when you connect your iphone.

3. Will it be able to sync with Outlook contacts? - Yes

4. Does it have a flight mode? - Yes

5. Does the browser use WAP sites or normal Internet - Normal HTML. It has Safari which is standard on a mac as explorer is standard on Windows.



I hope that answers your questions.
I am a programer. My question is:Can I use programs such as C# or other programing studios on IPhone?.
Does anyone know these questions?

1. Will iPhone have java games?

2. What are the ringtone options?

3. Will it be able to sync with Outlook contacts?

4. Does it have a flight mode?

5. Does the browser use WAP sites or normal Internet

First version of iPhone will not have a GPS receiver. There are rumors that it'll be available in the next version though. I doubt you can use office software on iphone. It would suck without keyboard anyway, even if you could.



Nokia E90 is too different to compare to iPhone: it depends on what you need/want. If you want to do office work, then obviously E90 is superior. E90 has much better hardware in general (except no touchscreen), but it's heavier and bigger.

Hello



Does this Phone have GPS ?

Can we use Excel on this phone ?



PLEASE ANYONE ????
I phone will be locked and it wont be unlucked for a long time .I work in US and i saw the phone and  tec guys said it cant be unlucked yet.....
iphone will be locked to "Cingular" and will be disunlockable because of chip locking
yes it will be locked onto vodafone only
Can you install additional programs & softwares to this phone? like in a Symbian phone?
Nobody knows how good the os will be but surely it will be better than symbian.Symbian os is just about acceptable on little nokia smartphones but C'mon the platform is a developers nightmare,Have you used symbian series 60 applications?Most are small inadequate creations.The most important quality in the iphone is the os and here's hoping it's good.
Does anyone know whether the iPhone will be locked ? like locked onto one telecom carrier ?
Agree with Macavelli, nothing experience like Iphone and as predicted Iphone will be trendsetter for next generation smartphone/PDA already true. Take a look at new HTC TOuch with all similarity with Iphone (WM6 standby UI and touch screen-only not multi touch as Apple had patented it.



Only problem with HTC is processors speed only 200MHz (what the...) and WM famous for lag time, slow respond, crash all time, complex navigation, cheap build materials, trial/error products, and looks like unfinished products. Really no compare with Iphone.









I agree with the person who said "Comparing iphone with N91 is not really a fair game - N91 is like 2 years old! Of course iphone is superior in almost every way."

But still, my arguement is that, all people see in iphone is that it's a big iPod with some cool looking features. For Macavelli information if all apple can do is to be better than 2 years old cell phone, then I guess they need to change their strategy alot. My comparison was just to show whatever they put into their cell phone otherthan multy touch input system is atleast 2 years old, and you are arguing the screen?! everybody who follows the cell phone market, knows that there is no better  screen out there than current Nokia.

If you want to compare top of the line I have no problem, lets put a test between N95 and iphoone and see who comes out first.

Your arguement about OS is completely irrelevent too, Symbian might not be the ideal one but before getting throught the tests you can not make any point with MAC OS either. Lots of Motorola's used to run un Linuz and that Linux was nothing like the Linux on PC.

I guess there is only one way to see how good this iphone is, and that's too wait till it comes out and get reviewed here on gsm.IF only this thing had 3G and GPS.  Does anyone know if this thing could support an external GPS adaptor using bluetooth???
I'll be camping out at the store on the night of the 28th.  If they only have one...IT'S MINE!  :-P
No 3g, no removed battery, no third party support more like icrap.
can i put music from my computer on an iphone?or just music from site?

New Generation Phone coming on 29th to kick all at once :)

It is safe to expect a 3g iphone before the end of this year.  It is also safe to assume there will be unlocked iphones available only a short while after they are released.  I'm curious to see how well it functions hands-on.  Hopefully GPS will be added to the 2nd gen, along with ichat and perhaps skype.
Yes they are crazy... Thats why they got so far.. Apple is aimimg to sell 8million iPHONES by december.. all for that price $499 and $599.

Jst think about it.. you spend $300 for ur video iPOD... Instead this is the same thing with a phone + a good camera.... So well it's a gr8 mix.. Well now the choice is urs.. Do u want to carry 3 different gadget or only 1 iPHONE
Does it support J2ME MIDP 2.0?
Itz.. my dream phone.... :)

Nice Phone but i can miss this one

I want dis fone so bad.  Will make me look a right bad boy and the girls will want to hang with me cos of this fone.
waste of time? no 3g but web browsing and email? h slow is tht going to be? better getting a samsung s700? 5mp camera... completely touch screen nd expandable memory... probably going to cost a fraction of this price...
looks very impressive... hope for a immediate release...
Hey the guys at apple have done a great job and i will definately get my self an iphone . Apple you are one of the best or may i say are the best.....

4gb=499 usd; 8gb=599 usd. these prices are exclusively through at&t (formerly cingular).
Guys,

The 4ne is gr8 as an iPod & camera built-in.

Ppl need GPS and without a receiver its useless installing navigon etc. Also since we talk of music, theres no FM in it which is quite lame; considering the price they expect ppl to shed; coming from Apple (which is nobody in the phone arena); its almost the price of a laptop, which is crazily insane. If you want ppl to buy iPhone instead of Nokia/SE/Moto, give them a chance to buy.
owwww nooohh. i want this phone. would you be mine 4ever?.. txtback!. asap!Hey Lord Vader, thx 4 the links "Why We Dont Want Iphone". Guess what its all nonsense in there and all the reviewer talk about is garbage.



Sure he got one point regarding Iphone permanent battery but other than that is old arguement i've been hearing all this time.



Why do u even compare Iphone with Blackberry qwerty keyboard? Does this author really now what is touchscreen means? Sure u can not type Iphone like the way u type ur old phone coz it has no buttons, For fair comparison u can compare ur so knowned PDA (without qwerty buttons) Windows based and Iphone, then u get exact picture whats so great about iphone.



a lot of pda doesnt have buttons even if they had, button is supersmall size that even kids will find difficult to type on that button.



Iphone is about to change the way we typed text before and all u people doing is complain? Come on i think u guys r not that stupid, deep down u guys really want this cool phone but too  embarrased to admit it coz u guys already make stupid decision buying junky symbian, windows, sony and korean phone.

I tell u guys r fool to believe if those phone build to pleased users. those phone software r not even OS, its called "baby OS" u morons. U will see whats OS really is when u see Iphone OS. Thats what i called A Mobile Phone.



Until then, stay out of this forums u all Iphone haters, if u hate Iphone so much dont even bother to click it just spend ur money on other junky phone.



Tada....
Why is it this ipod phone takes so long to be release in the market? Please release it immediately...for apple co.
No, you'll need an iTunes account to download mp3's onto the phone.



Also FYi, whomever resides in canada, we will not be getting the iPhone at all...
The iPhone is nothing new or a breaking ground innovation. The iphone is no better than the O2 XDA IIs. The O2 useS GSPR to connect to the internet, allow to add 4-8GB SD card, Faster CPU, Sliding keyboard,  do more things with Window Mobile than the iPhone.

go this this site to see how "great" the iPhone truly is.



http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com...d-questions/
do u have to load music and videos from iTunes? also does this phone have Java?
This isn't even 3G!?!? What garbage.
Heyy.. Im wondering if i order iPhone on the internet... will it work in my home country in South Asia?? There are two mobile phone service providers. Will it work im asking cos we dont have cingular down here!! Will I be bound by the damm two year agreement or it applies with only US users
Will this phone support A2DP Stereo Bluetooth??  It does NOT mention it anywhere in the specs.  That would be disappointing for this phone of all phones to not support it!
iPhone + iTunes = iProfit

u need to use itunes for it. also i noticed that it does not support Java applications. is this true?
Hopefully iPhone supports Java. Or installable softwares.
I have been using mobiles since 1997. I never had a better phone that makes me satisfied. I have seen IPhone and I thing I am in love with it. It has every thing that I wanted. About camera I would prefer to have Cybershot T10 coz I already have k800i and I am still not satisfied although it is the best camera phone available.



The only problem is gonna be no 3rd party applications. I know there are gonna be WEB2 based applications but we cant use them all the time and we can't find pirated software coz no one can buy every single applications.



But may be in feature we will have some applications and games that we can install directly on iPhone.



Any how I am badly waiting for this phone and I hope it will not break my heart.
This phone is amazing but its so bland, its pretty big and it dosn't have 3G! In my opinion the newly anounced Sony Ericsson K850 is the phone of the moment. Its packed full of features, similar size to the k800 and looks the biz!
its official that apple is launching iphone on 29th june 2007. well all depends that how market forces react to this device .. already there is slew of launches like LG's prada and HTC's touchflow no doubt these devices are better equipped as the manufacturers have rolled in more and more features as compared to iphone. but the success of iphone is very tricky as apple is relatively a new player in the phone market and these markets are stil dominated by equipment manufacturers. NO WONDER apple iPhone is a remarkable discovery....
"This phone is way ahead of its time" - "Mr Jobs you're the man". What are you guys going on about? Yeah its a nice phone and has some different features like the accelerometer but is that really important? No. its got touch screen and a 2Mp camera. Hardly cutting edge. N95 which is already on the market is a much better phone. 5Mp, wi-fi, gps. Apple just have a very good PR team and people get sucked in. I have a mac and i do like apple before people start saying i just have a vendetta against apple. But there are already better phones on the market.
this is not acurate... i thnk $499=4gb  $699=8gb
YES!!...



Greedy Apple is making you buy music via itunes.  In fact, they just hired anti-piracy music police.



This phone is so over-hyped, it;s almost amusing.



Save your cash....at least for now.
Guys does this phone synchronize with the outlook express...?, i want to have this phone but im confused about that synchronization thing...could anybody help me...?
This Phone will put the rest mobile into abyss. this will shine. Bye bye nokia and others , your 10years late compare to this phone...As you already noticed the technology being used in the iPhone is exceptional and is one and only of kind in the world, except the same Microsoft new Multitouchscreen PC
i luv this fone i really............. want one
HEYYYYYYYY!!!



i cant wait for the iphone



its gonna be BANANAS

B-A-N-A-N-A-S!!!!
i agree with please read, y buy this phone
Hello People:



Did you all read the post from one guy that saying the phone is not out yet and stop writing the review of the iphone. BUT he himself wrote that he had that iphone for 2 weeks..Please stop and think before you start writing something nonsense and comment on others.
This, revolutionary? LOL. its a touchscreen with 2MPx. its made by apple so no wonder why its the first to use this opperating system. what would apple have used Windows mobile? how useful is the accelerometer? are you goiing to spend all day rotating your phone? although it has good memory, it lacks a card slot. Java (and maybe Flash) will not work on this (even basic phones have this feature). it lacks 3G (which several of the newer phones have got). i have not noticed any games on this phone and almost every phone even phones which dont have color have games. it lacks basic features most phones have. your paying $499 - $599 with a two year contract! Apple has no experience in the phone industry. you have to use iTunes for loading music and video. no other phone does this and this just allows apple to make even more profit. you can not use a stylus, or gloves or anything other than your fingers when you touch it, so its sure to get greasy. it does not sync using WiFi. it does not support wireless sync via Bluetooth. the virtual keys make it slower to use than a Blackberry. it does not include any speed dial features.

18 June 2007 - Just over 10 days before the iPhone is due to go on sale in the US, Apple has announced improved battery life figures for the product and has revealed that the screen's surface has been upgraded.



The handset, which will be available to consumers at 6pm on June 29th, will boast up to 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of internet browsing, 7 hours of video playback or 24 hours of music playback and up to 250 hours of standby time.



This is a marked improvement of what had previously been expected from the iPhone's battery which was a more modest 5 hours of talk time and up to 16 hours of audio playback.



In a statement, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs boasted that the new battery life announcements meant that the "iPhone's battery life is longer than any other 'Smartphone' and even longer than most MP3 players".



Also for a quick pre-sale revamp is the 3.5-inch touchscreen surface, going from plastic to glass.



Steve Jobs stated: "We've also upgraded iPhone's entire top surface from plastic to optical-quality glass for superior scratch resistance and clarity".



Consumer demand for the iPhone is going to enormous, with many reports predicting over-night queueing and a police presence when the product goes on sale. This "bonus" information is only going to increase desire for the product, something that Steve Jobs seems more than happy to encourage:



"There has never been a phone like iPhone, and we can't wait to get this truly magical product into the hands of customers starting just 11 days from today."











I reckon this phone is going to be the ultimate multimedia phone ever !! I can't wait to put my hands on one of these beauties :)
You need to update the specifications on your web-site for this phone... Apple, Inc. has just upgraded their estimates to 8 hours of talk time (!), 10 days of standby time, 6 hours of Internet use, 7 hours of video playback or 24 hours of audio playback.



Please, tell me, what other existing mobile phone model can sustain all that activity? Stop referring to this phone as crap, claiming that you have tested it! As far as I am concerned, you can stick for the rest of your lives to your beloved N-Series or whatsoever! :->

A bit dissapointed. This is not a 3G phone.
is there going to be aim on it.somebody answer me
Mac osx is much like same as windows XP.. so.. is their a windows xp mobile? .. muhaahahahhaah
What a waste of time, good on apple for entering the market, but this is about the cell phone not the computer....
I have had an imate jam for 2 years that has touch screen, windows mediaplayer, camera etc. etc  ... so remind me, how is this revolutionary ?
This is going to be the typical Apple. It will have little software support but will probs be very reliable because nothing runs on it! I would much prefer to get myself the N95 at least Symbian is well known and has lots of software already out for it.
the iphone its all about cool factor,expensive,no buttons attached to a contract ,no joystick,no removable batterie,and apple reliability sucks hard!!! nokia n95 ist already 5 mg pix,apple its going to release a 2 mg pix camera ? hello!!!

nokia have a music phone that actually sounds better than any ipod!! the n91 what nokia has to do its a new phone, a n95 that sounds as good as the n91 and have a better  batterie life that phone will rule the phone industry for years!!!
Mac osx is miles better than any other operating system
more i read about this phone, the less i like it.  i have some friends who work for mac.  most of them are not that into the phone.  reason being there are no buttons.  it makes texting and dialing a bit harder because unlike other phones where you feel what your hitting, you need to be more mindful of what you press.  also, both battery and sim card are internal so hard shocking the phone (taking the battery out) can only be done by apple techs.  as a sales rep it pisses me off that basic trouble shooting i cant help my customers with.  ( i work for ATT).  by the way have fun dropping the phone and cracking the touch screen (seen it on the tytan treo and all other touch screens hundreds of times.  that and ever watching people use the internet on this doesnt even look that great.  anyway hope you guys have a wifi connection where you are at all times so you could stream some video or else have fun with edge.  i just done like the design nothing against the OS.  screen is cool and all but the rest is the kind of specs id expect for a hot new phone in 2005.  even the E70 which came out that year had 3g.  well i just done like the phone and wont be getting it but have fun with thast stuff guys
It seems as though the apple iphone has evoked a great deal of interest from many cell phone users. I was wondering how many people will actually be willing to pay for the phone and contract?I love the phone and I hope that when I buy it, I will not see a million other people walking around with one. Opinons...?
hey man, do you compare nokia n95 with iPhone? d'oh! iPhone is SLIM and n95 is the big phone ever seen in 2006-2007.. and simbian is... "naspa" (no good)i realy realy dont like the look of this phone. i hate it! dont you?
Iphone is like a ipod so you can chose what to buy 6 or 8 gb phone this is very atractive because in 8 gb u can store mare than 10000 mp3 and allsow you can move very fast in the menu....so think about it ;)!!!
guyz stop comparing this phone with other phones, it hasn't available yet...!
no radio, whats the point?
I don't understand what is so great about this phone. I might have nice and easy to use GUI, but I bet that soon most of the features are present in 3rd party Windows Mobile application. Some are already copied, like the "slide to unlock" thing and "free rolling" contacts app. But what sucks about the iPhone is that it's few years behind in hardware. At least these features are MISSING from the iPhone, but can be found in WM devices:

-3G

-HSDPA

-HSUPA

-GPS

-Slide out QWERTY

-Video call

-Java

-Flash

-640x480 resolution

-VoIP

-IrDA

-TV tuner

-FM radio

-Office tools

-TV-out

-Card slot

-USB host

-3D accelerated screen for 3D games.

-Screen cannot be used with stylus. It only recognize finger. This probably rules out:

-Handwriting recognition

-Handwritten notes

-Painting programs and everything that requires accurate pointing

-Camera could also be better, like in N95



Also I think that the iPhone's "homescreen" cannot be customized too much. WM devices can be customized to look like iPhone.
My friend honest and smart, i respect your comment about your phone, i told you guys in my first comment, this is whats gonna happen; Iphone is gonna blow out, everybody is gonna switch service to go to At&t to get this phone, is a good phone depending in what aspect you want to see it, if you are from America lets compare the chocolate, the sidekicks, the razors, and the upcoming iphone;

1.- Chocolate, too much advertising so many people pay 300 dollars for that phone and they end up saying the same thing, THIS PHONE SUCKS, LG is doing better everyday but still this company needs to do a lot to make a phone top of the line and superior, you dont compare LG with Nokia and Sony they dont make phones they make refrigerators and blenders, they are not specialized on cell phones.



2.- Sidekicks from SHARP, come on !!!! Sharp make calculators not phones, the screen on my old nokia 3300 is better than this phone, but is all about advertising and advertising on music videos and showing hip hop stars carrying this phone, paying this much for a phone that doesn't even have stereo bluetooth , the camera sucks, no picture messaging, the phone fall apart in 3 months, pf course is a sharp!!!.



3.- Razors, from motorola, they make their money with this is been like three years and they are stick with it, v3, v3i, v3xx, now v8, v9, whats next, v10, v12, v15, v19? L6, l7, l10, Its all about advertising, thats the answer why everybody wants this phones.



I'm not saying that this phones are good, but think about the HTC Touch is a comparison Apple is gonna make so much money with this device is cool, but be real is a brick its huge, heavy, for the size of this thing doesnt have half of the things available for a phone with this dimensions, i'm serious when i say that i had this phone i work for at&t, they let us have it to show people the advantages of getting this, my point of view  : dont trust a new company with a device that u are gonna be using everyday, every hour, its like saturn coming out with a V12 racing car for 200,000 dollars, would you guys buy it? theres a saying where i came from; the devil knows more because he's old, and not because is the devil, a Nokia is not gonna make many mistakes with new devices, SOny (the best) they are just making this phones every time better and better, iphone? Their first phone from apple? Thats my opinion, chose between honda, toyota, and KIA...

Thats it guys.



Peace Out.
Does this phone support STEREO bluetooth (A2DP)???????????????????????  Very disappointing if it does not!  The Nokia N95 does support it...
admittedly, this phone has the looks, but that's about as much i can say about it. reading the specs, you'll quickly realize that there are much better phones out there compared to this, but like the iPod, it doesn't stop people from being interested - i know i am.



on the whole, i think this phone has a lot of potential, apple just needs to explore and exploit it more - that or apple (like all of their producs) is just milking the cash cow.
it apears apple are launching on june 27th is this a USA only launch or will it be available in the uk. if so what network!! and when.
this phone is too damm big.
will the i phone provides fm because its most important

i think this is sweet
when this phone comes out any thing with a keypad will be owned
Very nice phone the only problem with this phone is its launching date when the hell apple will launch this phone
sorry guys I ment release
Do somebody know if apple is going to change the iphone before its erupean realese.

Do somebody know how many megaherz the processor in iphone got?
to the guy asking:

There aren't two 'models'. The cheaper version has 4GB and the more expensive has 8GB memory. The 'model' is the same.
Definitly best mobile phone ever, in every aspect...
Can anybody tell whether this instrument will support FM or not?the iphone still uses gsm frequency band (850, 900, 1800, 1900) quad band. last time i check, iphone belongs to at&t, (not verizon or sprint) a gsm network carrier and it'll be sim locked.
i had heard that the iphone was not using gsm...is that an error or is it?
somebody knows if the telephone use ship?
i have this phone already, since I work with the apple concept design group. Its thin, and has no bugs. It has everything from the commercials and more. Dont talk smack about the phone when you dont have it. I have it and its great.
seriously i wanted this phone when it was first showed to the public, but now reading all the downfalls i'm not sure  of getting it no more. I'm thinking of getting a real phone like HTC. Something more realiable.... peace!
As much as the hype iphone is getting, it remains the gotta have gadge of the year, hands down. I mean this is a phone for entertainment... don't compare it to blackberry or shiaaaty Nokia E90.
Hmmm soo u want it cuz u saw it on TV. Has anyone ever seen a real PDA phone? Hmmm no pen to work the phone... all touch... txt magin must be fun.. screen resolution is meh..it the first phone of its kind..unknown issues might arise...doesnt sync with exchange servers...soo a ragular phone that looks pretty :D
@ MightyOne



I am relaxed, web based software isn't what im talking about, I am talking about software installed and running on your phone, since it is that MAC OS on the mobile is what I am talking about.



Also thats my fault, but there is no Enterprise or Business server push email capabilities, doesn't compare to blackberry here. (As a lot of business people are inquiring about this, and that is needed)



Oh and just to let you know the iPhone sales guide was leaked and ways to tackle all objections such as these were given plus more, meaning there is a lot of working around to sell this phone for customer who know there stuff and know which questions to ask.



Also since they are locked in to 1 service provider, MMS capabilites could be there, but so far I have reasons to believe it wont but lets not get into that, you could be right or I could be right, doesn't matter.



Ez
Iphone is yet to come in hand 29 th july in US , and which kids of acsessories they plan for future we dont know some pridicted is as below : 1. wi-fi joypad for games , EA colabrated with Apple so i think so many games they will try on it like need for sppeed, 2. sterio blue tooth/ wifi headphone

3. wireless keyboard 4. wire less printing hub 5. share music with your computer wireless 6. external camera input like ipod 7.iphone carry case like ipod mini 8.pay and play music as ipod 9.video on demand 10. fm reciver for iphone like ipod and lots more u cant imagine so be cool and enjoy 29 th june and read actual user review on 1st july any way my birth day on 25 th july u can gift me 499 $ ok have nice day
I found the picture of IPHONE NANO in google. Hopefully it was true. The size is more compact in hand. other spec still in progress.
is every phone now going to be compared to the Apple iPhone..?



uh
go watch the vid on this phone on the apple site.. or just search it in youtube.. it is truly amazing what this phone can do..i have never been so impressed with a phone.. it csn cook u dinner!! but to waist time while i sit and wait till next yr down here in australia i will be getting my hot lil hands on the LG PRADA.. but for all you lucky peeps in USA, GET IT AND GET IT FAST ITS THE BEST THING YOU WILL EVER BUY.. Well untill they bring out iphone2 anyway..
i think this culd b a gud phone for music lovers bt cant say widout using it

waiting to get one in hand
This phone is huge. It plays music and all that but that doesnt make up for the ridiculous size. Maybe if it was smaller it would be more attractive. I like the design and Im sure it works great. The only fault is how big it is.
Hey, this phoen does work with a sim card and it will only work with AT&T for the time being. You will be unable to buy sim free versions of this phone either as per the tight control Apple has over its products. Also it uses the exact same USB connection that is already found on iPods. This Phone will not be available in Europe, SouthAsia, nor Canada until at least 6 months after its realese in teh United States due to a excusivity rights from AT&T. Also for those of you wantign 3g and other stuff, you can almost be certain that by christmas Apple will have another version out that will have all those otehr featursthat the AT&T network would be able to handle
the bottom line is that if you dont want this phone, dont freakin buy it.. and dont make any stupid comments... if you dont like it, then dont even look at it.. and what the heck are you saying that no body's gonna buy it? heck? are you sure with that? dont make nonsense comments pls...
I heard that some of the circuitry used in the iphone is made from the whiskers of kittens......
Hi, does anybody know if this phone has the same usb connection as the ipod?
so they said the battery is better then on the ohter phones ? really ? iphone discover a new technology for battery that no other company use? humm!! everything sou Marketing , its true we cannot change battery in iphone ? thta not sound good
and how do you play games with iphone ,using the touch screen ?? reallydear sirs





I have some questions with the iphone...





is it true that there is no mms function?



they say it cannot record videos... any truth in this?



any help would be greatly appreciated thanks sirs
I think that the iphone is great for listening and watching music videos...who cares if it doesn't have any games on it...if you want to play games buy a xbox, xbox 360, psp, ps2 or ps3...or go buy a computer...
Dont waste time on ths phone . it will be available i asia . next year.
can i use the apple iphone in the Philippines even though i bought it at the USA?
THANKS A LOT! =)



*heres why i said the iphone will NEVER e available out of the us*



this is straight from the at&t website...



"Why AT&T?

Apple has chosen AT&T, the best and most popular carrier.........
@ jimmy : your comment must be the most ridiculous I've read recently. The iPhone will run OSX (a unix based OS in case you don't know) on its core and it will be a totally locked OS. You can only run 3rd party apps that were written in AJAX/Web 2.0. It couldn't be more secure or closed.
I ttly luv the idea 4 this phone, but if u ask me I think that if u want this phone u should just wait. (duh) apple will probably come up with a 2nd generation iphone so l8er on u could get an even cooler phone, or you could get the same phone 4 a cheaper price!
I am considering buying the Apple iPhone  when it finaly gets here..Does anyone if the screen can be read when I go out into the sunlight as the Blackberry can? Right now I have a Razr V3i and I am unable to see the screen when I go out in the sunlight..Any idea?
mine are only the four below this...my first one was "its quite obvious" to vero...



the last one before this was "@ Mister, read..."
@ Mister,



read what i posted below!
heres the link to at&t's webpage that says what i said below...





http://www.wireless.att.com/ce...estid=116367
*heres why i said the iphone will NEVER e available out of the us*



this is straight from the at&t website...



"Why AT&T?

Apple has chosen AT&T, the best and most popular carrier in the US with over 62 million subscribers, to be Apple's exclusive carrier partner for iPhone in the United States.



With this multi-year exclusive partnership, iPhone will only be available with wireless service from AT&T. Working together ensures seamless integration between network and device."
As with most phone users I like having a camera on my phone but am not that bothered what MP it is as long as you can actually make out objects in the picture..... BUT not having any video capture capabilities has completely put me off this phone.



Hopefully when it is released in the UK Apple will have allowed for this and updated a couple more of the phones features such as adding MMS, voicedialing, and allowing downloaded MP3's to be used as the ringtone (fingures crossed as apart from these the phone looks great).
Go read the first REVIEW before buying the iPhone, there's so many problems...!



http://www.engadgetmobile.com/...rst-reviews/
To all you nokia lovers:

Of course the N95 is cooler in comparison to the iphone's features! Detachable battery, HSDPA, 5 mp camera, etc. But the N95 retails $700+. If you think about it, wouldn't the iphone have just the same features if they charged more for it (like nokia) and jam all that extra stuff in? Oh btw, the N95 doesn't have touchscreen so there is no backup when the center buttons break, as it always does with nokia phones. It' a dirt trap. Also the N95 has cr@ppy battery life, worse then 1st generation ipods. Can you imagine??!
Hi Everyone.

Cingular (ATT) just released their phone plans for the iphone and although it's not as bad as many people expected, it still costs a pretty penny. In one year you will have paid for two extra iphones if you pick the 100$/month plan. I'm actually considering the 80$ plan. Funny thing is, they offer unlimited web use but cap text messages at 200??? My question to cingular users is: Is it worth it? I've heard some scary things about dropped calls, crappy customer service, network that works when they want it to. Or will it be better now that it is with AT&T?



Does anyone know if the iphone can be unlocked to use with other service?
look at this...

http://youtube.com/watch?v=F1haOlYrtuE
dude this phone is so gay... no gps, no pic messaging, no 3g, the battery is built in, and so after like 400 charges, which is bout a year, its gonna die and u have to send it in to apple and pay to get a new one.



i want htc kaiser
For me, after see the vid is kindly cool. Plus with multi touch screen function and also freaking cool ipod features included. Base on what i already see, iphone will change all the phone now day and bring up it to the higher level. With Mac OS it might properly be the best phone eve created for business, student and also ipod user as well. Well done Apple.
to VERO: take it easy, after 6 month iPHONE you can bay in all world.i think aplle rocks fail nokia ...google maps wooooooo 29 june lunch today
The iPhone will only work with AT&T and only AT&T.  It will not work with any other US or international GSM carriers.  If you travel abroad you will have to use AT&T's international roaming service.  There is no way you can get an "Unlocked" version of the phone either without activating it through Apple's iTunes it becomes a pretty expensive paper weight.  Just thought I should clarify this for everybody.
No 3G

No open SDK

AT&T only

No Java/Flash

No IM/VOIP client

I'll stick to Symbian.
just wondering if this phone has a simcard slot as every gsm phone. otherwise, the sim chip is embedded to the phone which is similar to cdma or pcs phones.

hii guyz

at this moment apple iphone is locked and will only work with at&t,regarding the features iphone lacks-

1)a2dp

2)mms

3)voice dialling

4)3g

5)mp3 songs cannot be set as ringtone

but apple is commenting that they will fix this by new firmware releasing most probably on 17 of august till that you have to run it the way it is

It is very nice and smart phone I wish I want one
This phone is so overrated. If you look through this site and compare there's a crapload of phones out there that are better and cost the same if not less.
cool phone but itz gonna launch after 1-2 years in india
No 3G? only Edge?

very strange to design such new device with such older GSM network.....
Well, the first reviews are in. But you may have missed some of the more interesting factoids unearthed by the trio of gadget reporters deigned worthy by El Jobso to get a pre-launch iPhone. Here's a few fresh n' interesting iPhone facts right off the presses:



The mobile version of OS X or whatever it is the iPhone runs takes up 700MB of the device's capacity. Damn son!

There's no way to cut, copy, or paste text! WHOA! Big, big mistake.

No A2DP support. That, friends, is such a huge bummer right there.



Sorry, music can't be used as a ringtone -- even if it's just a raw MP3. No additional ringtones will be sold at launch.



On a PC the iPhone syncs with Outlook for calendars AND addresses! Noice.

It supports Exchange in some capacity, according to Walt, but he doesn't exactly say how.

Pogue again confirms document file reading -- but not editing -- for PDF, Word, and Excel (only).

Adobe Flash support is officially out. It's just not in the browser. Neither is there any other kind of embedded video support. Sorry everybody, that's that.



It will take snaps, but won't record video. How can Apple love YouTube as much as it does and not realize cellphone-shot movies make up a sizeable chunk of the crazy crap you find on there?

More after the break!



Oh, and no MMS. And sorry, no voice dialing, either.

Contact groups can't be emailed as contact lists.



Apple sez between 300-400 charges the iPhone will lose battery capacity -- you'll send it in and get the cell replaced for a fee. Meh. We knew this would be the case, but still, meh.



Apple can (and supposedly will) be rolling out periodic updates -- no surprise there.

Battery life is, somehow, almost as mind-blowingly good as Apple claims for calls, music, and movies.

As we suspected, users are prompted with lists of WiFi networks if you're not nearby a trusted hotspot. We've seen this on other phones, and we're afraid this would get friggin annoying.

It's said to be very scratch resistant. The facade both front and rear apparently just doesn't pick up marring like regular iPods do.

Voice quality is said to be good -- not great.



Anything else we missed from in there?

Official launch date for the iPhone is June 29th 2007 6:00pm at all AT&T retail store. Apple's official iPhone and training manual can be found at www.Thegadgetlink.com/blog courtesy from Boy Genius. The FULL 65 pager list out all the functions and details of this phone as well as the plan of action from AT&T themselves.

http://www.mobile-review.com/f...ex_eng.shtml


11 functions missing in the iPhone:



* Cut/Copy/Paste option

* Stereo Bluetooth (A2DP)

* MP3 ringtones

* Adobe Flash not supported in Safari browser

* Video capture

* MMS-messaging

* No removable battery

* No edit of Word and Excel files ï¿½ you can only view them

* Direct iTunes access

* Instant messaging

* Games
That is correct the I phone will only be available to AT&T and no other service, because the simcard is built into the phone.
finally the wait is almost over and everyone who has talked crap about this phone is going to shut up when everyone is going to be buying this phone tomorrow and the reviews are going to go through the roof!!!!!!!!!!!
Go read the first REVIEW before buying the iPhone, there's so many problems...!



http://www.engadgetmobile.com/...rst-reviews/
and i would never think twice about getting an iphone, im satisfied with my n95, and im only 14!



again, really sorry.  do accept.
Tity_Killa,



yeah, i agree with you about the razr thing.



and i said sorry about what i said.
Nokia N95 is way way better than this phone.. iphone is gonna end up like the Razr..mass produced and common!
that's not true, tell me, how many hackers are there attacking windows/dos-based systems compared to open systems like Mac OS X? How many viruses are a threat to Windows as compared to Mac OS X? which has higher security, unix based on dos based?wat a phone dude oosome man looks,features,good sound of quality make dis phone completed entertainment....those who r muzic freaks its good for these guys...
The device doesn't even allow you to do MMS messages, and you can't use your own music for ringtones. Apple would have mad more money if they just let the device be sold on T-Mobile and AT&T instead of a stupid 5 year contract exclusive. I hope the I-phone flops. I wonder when we see the number of units sold, and returned.
i just got the iphone too, actually it turned on but this morning it froze and i cant restart it, and it has some more bugs, i have an appointment with the genius bar but the line is so big there its stupid my next appointment is monday 5pm
Iphone is about design, style & interface..



stop using old-fashion devices & its time to walk towards the future..



Cheers!


http://iphone.macworld.com


2 guys from this macworld web site alredy have their iphone , but having problems puting them work LOL
LG KE850 Prada is touch screen also...have radio..etc..etc
hey guyz,



http://www.anandtech.com/mac/s...x?i=3025&p=3
look at this url it shows how sim can be swapped in to iphone but as it is it doesn't works
Plz tel me any body is this phone works in india
just got the iphone!! WOW. thats all i have to say, worth every penny!
Good luck to people that buy this phone and their battery stuffs up after 12 months like most ipods do.  No removable battery means another expensive apple paperweight
please more about it
Play with it for a while, then comment on it...

First impressions r always misleading...
Got it  !!!

Just finished synch' all my music contacts photos etc - it's a breeze!



Everything works as advertised and better!



coverflow, picture and web pages "pinching' is awesome! Web is slow on edge.google maps, wow!



3 biggest surprises:

- bright, crispy contrasty screen at resolution at 160 pp

- typing on virtual keyboard ..is great and fast! with zero mistakes.

- smoothness and speed of jumping between so many features..no bugs !



~

SE , Nokia should go back to drawing board.



...actually i heard the announcement that the us launch of the iphone would be $1400 over 2 years!! is it reported wrong? that is very expensive but what did we really expect from apple? jacking the price based on an unproven reputation for producing mobile phones...
this phone is do big, i dont think you should waste your money on it
Brand Phones arent really reconmmended.

1. You could Waste Lots of money

2. G500, N91, e65, and others hav emore features and better software. Btw Iphone no UTMS or anything special.. ALL BASIC..

3. Features are not much.. But i guess people like Brands. = \

Its an Ok Phone from Apple. Just more income for them = ]
I still think that SE W960 will be the iphone killer. You have to consider that this is Apple's trial and error effort to be part of the Wireless Communication era. So, bugs will be all over it and...I'm just not an Apple lover...Good luck Apple though,but at the end of the day SE will still rock the GSM world.
i will be wait for 2nd or 3rd edition of iphone .. waiting for 3G network supporting .. and card slot maybe ..



its bad that is dose not support 3G network .. which mean no fast internet connection ,, no video calls ..



thats really bad ,,
yes , u can buy the iphone and activate it with att, without penalties,i dont think they will give u a discount if u already get one, and if they do give a discount u may have to renwel your contract.

att its a good company , wich is not good is the kind of the cell phone u are using.

Any information about how to activate or sync the iPhone you can find it in apple's webpage. And yes it can ONLY be used with At&t as carrier. One thing I was wondering, it doesn't take a gsm chip, does it?many pawned this iPhone by N95

at reviews.. they released it too late.
hey guys....



as mentioned there are 11 flaws in d iphone so i think people out there are smart enough to select wat they want...guys i really wanted to get an iphone...but im frm india n i think iphone wil b available here only in 2008...bu i think by then apple wuld have made all the short comings fixed...ive used lots of models of all brands ...n95 is d best guys...as of now u cant compare iphone n n95...so plz chill guys...
I think, Iphone is better than E90. Just check the product of the Apple whenit comes to appearance and functionality(ipod, nano,etc)
I am technology maniac. I am always fooled, but I can't stop running after new technologies. I'll buy it whatever the circumstances.
I am M. Baligh and I love studying all new technology without purchasing any. This is my hobby and I will not get this iphone never.
I was surprised to see so many internet sites saying that iPhone's release will change the mobile industry. All their comments ultimately points to Nokia. Nokia is the leader and they could have made these kind of phones a lot earlier. As a leader, Nokia should be ashamed.
O2 PDA's are alot better than the i phone like

Matt don't get it + you have to put music onto it through i tunes
Woo the i phone is a rip off

it is an I pod in a phone but thats just a mp3 player in a phone which is common

the camera is only 2 Mp where you can now get 5 mp

does not have video

Its a rip don't get it
WooowoOOw
what is so good about this phone. A o2 pda phone can do so much more
So expensive but i like it....
Well, I got one... I was awaiting for it last 6 months. After all - just a huge frustration. Yes - you can view video, yes - you can see weather report and listen to the music and even multiply 1234 by 9876 in a few seconds... that's it. The major thing it lacks is the phone itself. Apple is probably a generation behind of all other manufacturers - simply speaking - it just sucks... I'm not talking about nice wrapping - it's really nice and cool. BUT - the phone itself is BAD. It has an average reception in place where anything else has great. It has NO signal in place when all other phones (4 in my household) show at least 2..3 bars. It shows some signal when it sits in the cradle, but once taken in hand - no signal at all. Its EDGE is nothing... really - no signal around Staten Island, around Brooklyn (Bay Ridge, Govanus Hwy, nothing around Brighton), nothing in lower Manhattan. In a few places where EDGE worked - one may loose patience waiting for one simple page loads up... each video of YouTube - 3 minutes waiting...

Camera - what can I say - it's 2Mpixel... That's it - could be worse. No video mode - I suspect that Apple will charge something 3 months from now for an "upgrade" to convert the still photo camera to a video one...

The above is not counting a crude 2 year contract with recently returned back "at&t" and the fact that the phone is dead without it... Oh.. yes - the phone virtually stills when you try to send an e-mail and there is a low or no data-speed - it's "dead" like an old Dos or Win3.1 - no real multitasking or scheduler. Yes - it's fashioned and cool and I'm going to "enjoy" it a full month before returning it back and canceling AT&T contract for loosing $36 activation fee (I consider it as a cost of experience). Oh yeah - it's NOT a OS X inside - it's something looking close to it (the dashboard and apps and Safari doesn't sync bookmarks with my Firefox the same way as Mail doesn't do it with Thunderbird). For those who don't know - OS X is an Unix based (BSD) operating system with open user interfaces - while this one is something absolutely locked and brain-dead (yes, it's brain-dead user friendly - it "knows" what the brain-less user wants). By the way - the "cool" orientation interface change works ONLY in Browser and Photo mode, all other functions always in a Vertical mode (well, the youtube videos are played ONLY in  - horizontal mode :-)). The last drop - this gadget which has all possible means of data transfer uses ONLY cradle and wire to sync up to your computer - the WiFi and Edge are NOT used. And the last - talking about this thing  is supposed to be the phone at first - when it's in DATA mode on EDGE - it does NOT receive calls, the AT&T sends call to your voice-mail AND you have NO even idea that you're missing [perhaps] important call when you're watching some nice clip or staring at a WEB page... Yeah... they forgot that this thing is the phone...

I don't have N95 nor E90, but now I really want one - Apple's mountain delivered a mouse (for those who understands what that expression means)... Very sad - I'm and all my family are Mac lovers (this review is typed now in my home Mac-mini - the System admin of this WEB site may check the log and confirm this fact :-)) and I did not expect such a set up from Apple (after over 6 month waiting time).
I have n95 but iphone have better design than nokia.
y just now?..right after i got my n73?!!..damn you iphone!!!..yakimochi!!
Guys Guys.. Hold on!



Why are you comparing this with the N95, Its double the price!



Both phones have evolved from differnt concepts, What ever you scream out, N95 is still jus a phone!



This is a innovation from apple! appreciate it... Iphone is way better than N95!for the price...





wat the  r u insane????







I got both phones N95 and Iphone, and compared them, N95 is good but its too expensive, GPS is the only thing better, battery sucks, internet is ok. Iphone battery is good, its really easy to use and its fashion, you can watch videos better than the N95, its fast and who cares about 3G? Iphone is the best one on the market right now. About the camera N95 is just little bit better, the 2MP Iphone is very nice too!

FROM 1 to 10 WHO IS BETTER

Internet N95=7 Iphone=9 .. n95 has 3.5g and more advance  wifi capablity

Maps N95=8 Iphone=10 ... iphone has a google map only . n95 has "GPS"

hi guys. I saw on tv people lined up and got iphone out of apple store. are those the phone with AT&T contract ? or there is AT$T contract one and there is one you can get unlocked one (providers free) straight from apple store ? thanks
600 bones and no a2dp?  wtf?
omfg, this fone sucks, can't even do anything with the 2 mp camera and can't record videos, i got my nokia n95  3 months ago and i love it, if u guys want to get a better fone, wait for the nokia n98, its got 7.2 mp camera and touchble screen
your all rong watch this



http://www.mobile88.com/mobile...20468&ID=666it has fm radio?
if phones were cars, the IPhone would be a ford explorer with firestone tires and a nice paint job.   My point...there are better equipped mercedes and ferraris out there, consider the nokia n95, htc tytn and manny more. I know this is apple's  1st try, but even the iphone v2 will not come close the nokia n98 with its 7mp camera. I suspect though that given apples reputation, they will get better and more competitive, maybe even a lambourghini someday.

But for now this phone does not compare to say then nokia n95.   and thats apples to apples
599 for a 2 mp camera....not worth it....
get ready to replace the battery soon.
Hi Guys.

We'll all appreciate if the owners came out with their reviews of iPhone.

Now from what I see as specs -



1. iphone's bluetooth is only for handsfree.

2. No EDGE. Maybe when it comes to Asia we'll have it.

3. We dont see any Office applications!!! Maybe this is a multimedia phone and not a business phone.

4. it has no IRDA!!

5. No 3G

6. No memory card.



Now how do we exchange files/stroke images etc?? Since it has no EDGE nor 3G we cant even email it.



Dear 1st Owners of iPhone. Please give us your reviews on

1. How long does the battery last.

2. Speed of internet acces. I normally try www.livingston.net to check the speed of the connection.

3. Sound quality as a normal phone / bluetooth phone / speaker phone.

4. Do you have any dropped calls.



Hoping to see these questions answered soon.



Creatar
Can you say not worth it.  Over priced Idod that you can call on.  Its your new paper weight.  Call it Icrap.
Just bought it.  Had is 3 days and took it back.  Didnt meet my expectations.  Internal antena with not enough power.  battery life was weak. And was dificult to wirk with!  DO NOT WAST YOUR HARD ERNED $.
no mp3 ringtone and no video recording
Just got the Iphone. Went into an Apple store just to play with one and ended up walking out with one. Heres something for all you phone nuts. I finally understand, the Iphone is not about the features even though it comes decently loaded it doesnt touch the N95, yes i know. HOWEVER, as i said its not all about the features- its the experience, innovation, there is no other phone in the market like it.

Apple didnt try to take this phone and cram a bunch of stuff into it to compete with something like the N95, they just wanted a completely unique, innovative, phone with a fantasticly fluid user interface with features that appealed to everyone and that you wont only use "once" and they def accomplished that with this phone. There is def no other phone that can match the "cool'  factor and there def wont be another like it. Its Apple, it just works.
Let me clear this out of the way so it doesn't seem like I'm an apple hater. I currently own a mac book pro and I previously had an ibook G4. I'm a mac fan but I have to say that Apple really outdid itself this time by producing and introducing to Americans ...bull crap! This is way below what I expected from Jobs. No HSCSD,No GPS, No slot for expanded memory, a built in battery that is irreplaceable, a phone that does not support 3G and did any of you who purchased this so called wonder phone notice that you cannot even perform a simple MMS task?? C'mmon! What's really smart about this phone? It's a pretty phone no doubt but pretty isn't what smart phones are about. What office product does it have(word,excel,power point,ilife, iweb,iwork ... what)? Touch screen is nice and beautiful but so is a syncing feature that allows transfer of important files from phone to computer; but ofcourse the iphone only allows syncing to transfer music files. Who exactly was this piece of crap geared towards? It definitely wasn't geared towards the business class. I'm really disappointed because of all the hype only to find out that it is no better than my motorola A780. I really hope Apple listens to critics,apply some of their recommendations and make the next update(iphone 2.0 which is inevitable) a REAL smartphone. Maybe by taking cue from the Nokia N series (especially the N95 and N93i) and the i-mate ULTIMATE series (5150.6150.7150 and 8150), Apple and Steve Jobs will bounce back from this terrible mistake called an iPHONE!!!
This phone is the Vince Carter of phones. Lots of flash and glitz but little substance. I will pass on it...I will be waiting for the one true phone beast...the HTC Kaiser!
can you buy ringtones with this phone via WAP push?
it must cost loads. how much?
I drove down to the US on Canada day to buy one. I got it (i didnt need the 2 year plan since I am canadian and did not meet the credit requirements - no us mastercard)



I have an N91, and N95 and now an Iphone. Ill let people know my impressions ...so far pretty warm/hot i must admit)



Ill get back to you all



stan
No official review yet on GSM Arena, the best portal on GSM devices??! This is odd?! Look forward to read it.
it is so lame that u cant put ur own tracks as a ringtone, and u have to use their lame ass ringtones, also u cant choose what message ring u have and u cant use ichat or any sort of IMing system on it
Let see. You're paying 600 bucks for a touch screen and a good looking interface. These Apple fanboys are so sad saying the iPhone revolutionized the cell phone... most of them probably has no idea what is going on in the industry.



Its no wonder the iPhone does not receive any hype in Japan - the people who actually knows how to make a proper cell phone.
iphone and Nokia N95



Camera: 2mpx (iphone)

0.3vga (Nokia)

Screen: 3" 62K colour multitouch (iphone)

0.5" black white plastic (Nokia)

Satnav: Google maps/intergrated gps (iphone)

none (nokia)



May I ask you are in in teh right mind you just posted the worst thing ive seen Iphone fan I guess now to fix your mistakes you will be quiet supriesed seeing the N95 on top or not.



Camera 2mpx (Iphone) 5mp Carl Zeiss Camera (N95) With 30fps recording near dvd quality + 0.3mpx vga camera for video calling.

Screen 16million color 2.6inch screen (N95) 16million color 3.?inch touchscreen Iphone.

GPS. Nokia N95 has a built in GPS chip which means no internet fees when using the gps.

Apple Iphone dosent have a built in GPS chip meaning when using the gps software you weither need a bluetooth normal gps to send the data or get charged by your provider because you use GPRS to retrive the data for  the GPRS software.

Memory- I phone 4/8gb no card slot.

Nokia N95 160mb internal + micro SD card slot for currently memory cards up to 4gb until the 8gb cards come out.

At the moment the only place i see the

Netwrok-WiFI-BOTH,3.5g HSDPA (N95) 2.5g Connection (Iphone).

The onyl area the Iphone can beat a N95 is the Screen because its bigger but it is a personal prefference for the touchscreen it does not prove its better i like the DS because its inovative but do i want to select thigns on screen just to get the number pad to dial someone imagine an emrgancy where you need to dial 000 or 911 it'd take a while longer then just sliding the keypad down and dialing.

But teh screen it bigger so the Iphone for screen

Memory Id say tied because the n95 will match it once the 8gb card comes out and in anotehr yearb we will be seeing 12gb cards so the N95 will get a lead here but not now id say tied.

Camera N95 by long shot 2mpx vs 5mpx.

Network N95 because it has 3.5g compared to the 2.5g

GPS-Nokia once again because it has a built in chip.



to jc.

"i think ill stick with this one for a while"



your gonna have to for 2yrs..
nice what other phone can do atleast as much as this...Ok ... so why would any sane person would pay 1400$ for this crap wrapped in black plastic? This phone is so not gonna make it in Europe, because here ... yeah ... we have real phones with real technology.

How can anyone be so ignorant and ask such a high price for a phone that does practically nothing...oh my god it has the ability to play google videos and itunes ... yeah , so does my 50$ symbian-based Nokia can.
W960 is good, but regardless of it's greater resolution, the I-phone will ultimately produce a more natural picture... 256k's cannot comper even in it's wildest dreamz to 16 MILLION!!!!
I just brought a iphone on ebay for $720 but its broken. Doesnt do anything at all unless i squeeze it and then it squeeks
Like I was saying sometime ago iPhone is a 2G phone and is missing a lot of features, even voice dial is not there(ridiculous). Apple completely ignored biz people who require organizer, creation of qick documents, tables on the go. iPhone is missing all those features. Lack of 3G and ability to watch Youtube videos is completely annoying because of slow Edge speed.



It may be a nice toy, but not for a serious user.



I love my HTC TYTN and will wait for HTC Kaiser
what woudl you do with FM when you have 4gb songs ful of phone????
who cares about FM radio, this phone has an iPod in it!!! I just bought one 2 days ago! It is amazinnnnng, highly recomended
Apple didn't even incorporate the A2DP protocol so you can use Bluetooth stereo headphones.



Even my Samsung D900 has that.  It works terrific with the Jabra D620  .  Can answer calls with a tick on the headset and when you hang up the music comes back on from the MP3 player.



Only thing I like about the iPhone is it has a larger screen.  For the rest, they can keep it.



Am looking later this year what Nokia and Samsung will come up with.  I predict they will beat Apple's butt.



Of course, Americans are still quite far behind the rest of the world in cellphone tech and available phones.



to dazzi, if i want to swtich ill jsut cancel the serice no big deal, and or jsut stay with at&t adn switch phones the two years doesnt mean anything
hi..

watz wrong wit gsmarena guys...

till today they hav not shown iphone in the list of latest release...



wake up gsmarena...

the entire world now knows that the iphone is out and with a BIG bang...
how active my iphone in puerto rico?
Hey i agree. The iPhone is cool an all but the SE W960 Kicks ASS!!!
Where's the iPhone review by gsmarena.com? I prefer the SE W960 instead.
completely agree with Trinity! you can't compare this uselessy expensive iPhone (it is JUST a phone!!!) to a PPC. Brick or not, I luv my TyTN...
it will be available in Europe later this year and in Asia Early 2008, it will be a modefied version and it might have 3g...
Of course it's simple and easy to use because there isn't much to use it for. Just handfull of icons at the mainscreen. Old switchboard phones were easy to use also. Just pick up the phone and tell the switchboard lady who you want to call.



But how easy it's for the more advanced user. Most of the SMS generation can type SMSs with numpad & just one hand without looking at the phone. Try this with your iPhone.



Or can you unlock the phone and call to one of the quickdial numbers when you are using handsfree and the phone is in your pocket?



How about managing the music playback while the iPhone is in your pocket or backpack? Can you use stereo bluetooth headset and issue smart voice commands like "play Elvis"? And it there even EQ in the music player?



Then there is the missing e-mail attachement issue, missing copy paste, etc. And how easy the file managing on the iPhone. There isn't any, so it's very easy! Get my point?



iNerds are already crying at Apple's forums that Appls should add feature X to the iPhone v2.0 (btw. all those features exist in latest PPCs). If you want all the features, then get pocket PC or real smartphone. If not, then get dumb iPhone.



I hate Windows (who doesn't) but I have to admit that with little effort, PPC can be made very easy to use. I would show my Trinity, but I don't want to make all the iNerds cry. OK, I'll just describe it:

-I unlock it just like the iPhone

-contacts browsing is just like in iPhone (flick with finger to scroll)

-plus I can call to quickdial numbers with 5-way D-pad without looking at the phone

-I have lots of different typing methods to choose from, but I prefer tenGO Thumb. The iPhone should have this option too. I bet tenGO would work better than the current keyboard in iPhone

-standard MP3 player with ogg support and EQ (can be controlled with D-pad)

-very inteligent voice commander (no need to prerecord anything)

-handwritten notes and voice notes

-messenger with file transfer support

-file explorer pretty much like in XP

-internet radio for listening shoutcasts

-phone profiles, like home, work, loud, etc. Silent meeting profile is switched on/off automatically according my meetings in calendar

-voip & skype

-internal GPS & best available car navigation software

-google maps just like in iPhone + GPS support

-java & flash

-huge dictionary that can talk

-Painting app with lots of same features as in Photoshop. So I can paint with stylus and delight my wife with MMS messages.

-Office tools that can actually do something.

-guitar (or any instrument) tuner. Not just any sample player, but real tuner that tells me if some note is flat or sharp.

-universal IrDA remote controller

-picture viewer that allows me to smooth zoom with one hand instead of some silly pinching move with two hands (ever heard of a scroll wheel Steve!)

-telnet & SSH

-bit torrent client

-secured wallet for storing passwords and such.

-USB hard disk functionality

-3G, HSDPA, Wi-Fi, etc...

-video call

-can be used as modem for laptop (with bluetooth of USB)

-sh!tload of classic games like Tomb Raider, UFO enemy Unknown, Age of Empires, Heroes of Might & Magic, Worms, Virtual Pool 3D, etc...

-and lots more...





So, did I manage to convert anyone to the dark side? Just get a freakin' pocket PC and pimp it!



it does seem a shame that you tube has its own dedicated touchscreen button but the device cannot record video ??This would have been good as you could send your mini video direct to the site.
Not impressive! only has 2mp cam, no video, no 3G, no infrared...boring! google maps? c'mon, we dont need that. guys wait for Nokia N95! iphone will surely cringe!
there is no FM radio
sorry i didnt notice, now i see that i can read pdf files and see excel sheets but cant edit them



the simcard is placed on the top right and it is built in, the back cover doesnt open u are right

this is why when u buy it u have to register it on itunes and u actually lose ur old simcard with all contacts etc.



also,

as i said before



no video recording

no mms

no "select all" function on emails so u have to delete one by one

u cant select ur own ringtones, its only what comes with the phone

speaker is very bad, and it doesnt see java, only video-stream which is only youtube,





and the internet is not even fast.





battery life is good
It has office applications, u can easily read .pdf and word documents. I just liked it. I really think that it is much more better that N95. And easy to use at the same time.finally i got my iphone yesterday through cingular retailer. i had to wait for almost 35 minutes to get it there as it w.w.went out of stock when i reached .. cingular's staffer john made me comfortable as he said the logistics team had sent a truck load to the store to replenish the iphone stock..

after the wait i got a perfectly packed iphone box straight from the carton that had alomost 36 iphone in it ...

i was told to activate the phone using itunes software on my windows vista laptop..

.. i thot i would just have to plug the phone with my pc to get it working and it would take a  min or two as john had explained me .



to my surprise it dint work that way . while activating it took like 50 min to flash the message that iphone is now ready to rock ..



though for the music lovers this device is  wonderful and even wonderful as picture viewer and storage ..



now let me explain u the iphone as a phone...

as phone apple will have to REWORK-REDISCOVER-REINVENT..



most important: our hands dont get that going on touch screen .. often fingers slip while locating keys .. fingers imprints look awfull on the screen .. really scratch prone .. already got couple of scratches on its back while keeping it on surface..

voice quality is bearable .. ON A SCALE OF 10 iPHONE CAN COMFORTABLY SCORE 6 POINTS ..TIL NOKIA BRINGS OUT THE KILLER N98 AS HEARD WITH 7.2 MPX CAMER 3G AND 32GB INTERNAL MEMORY





ok, i go again... where's the iphone review by gsmarena????????????
n95 sold almost a million in it first week so?

apple should fix alot of thing

bluetooth is useless only work for headset

not mp3 ringtoones, no custom ringtones at all.

no video recording.

camera have no setting at all.

no 3g.

horrible call quality and reception (ITS A PHONE!!!)



rubbish touchscreen is poor and as screen gets marked function will get poorer
The Phone works without a sim card in it, but the phone has to be activated under AT&T. Great phone, a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it.
LG prada is also touchscreen



http://www.pradaphonebylg.com/
well can anyone tell whether this phone will work in india????

i might get it but i am a lil vary about the fact that whether its gonna work in india???

another touch screen mobile , now Samsung :





http://www.symbianer.com/post/...rt-F700.html

"700.000 sold in 1st weekend!"



And 1 billion flies eat horse manure! So?
700.000 sold in 1st weekend!
Yes, the phone works with a SIM card. And yes, it is easily removeable (top of the phone). Go the AT&T site, download and read the iPhone pdf manual for instructions.
so is that i yes or a no or is it a wait people are working on it
Yes the Iphone works with the SIM card (GSM 4 band)
where's gsmarena's review????????????
sim card doesnot work with iphone.
Booo!!! the iphone is whack!! I can't believe the hype over this thing. Touch screen, so what. 2 meg camera, so what, those are old specs. I heard you can't even set your personal music as your ringtone. WTF!! I own an asus p525, nokia n93i. Either one of my phones will put this thing to shame. Good one Apple, you just fooled half a million people to buying your out dated pda.. Just for that i'm buying a dell m1330 tomorrow..
Dude iff you below mentioned request has been taken i to consideration, then the phone will cost $5000, instead of $500 :-)
It may be the fast selling phone during the weekend. But whe I was in the NY apple store, I saw over a handful of people returning the phone. I tried the phone out at the store and I just have to say it is rather slow to type on the iphone which is my biggest grudge and the call quality was okay. Otherwise this is just a glorified PDA.



I would rather wait for the next gen iPod video instead of spending money on this phone.
"IPHONE: The fastest selling mobile fone in history!



520.000 units in just 3 days. it beats any mobile fone sales in history.

Iphone also managed to convert of its 50% buyers to change from their old provider to AT&T."



but how many returns Iphone is a gimmick
a Nokia , or Erickson ,or Lg,etc soon will put touchscreen (some already have it)phones like the iphone for sell , but this phones have java,MMs, card slot,etc etc, so who will want an iphone!
One question real quick... what if i buy the phone in US and bring it back to Japan? Am i able to use the US iphone in Japan or in any country in Europe and Asia? Thanks
the best phone ever made by mankind. i have it its the best
its not even 3G..
hey peoples, this phone is insane. not good insane but bad insane!! what in the hell is going on with this phone. 520k units in first three days is ridiculous!! it a m o b i l e phone for chist sakes!! people are insane, they would throw their money to an idea instead of the product itself. it is not yet the best phone out there. 520,000 units is absolutely insane and a message to all u people who have splashed, u will one day make me a very wealthy man!!
just to let you no, the iphone will be exclusive to o2 when released in the uk.
No Songs as Ringtones

No Flash Support

No Instant Messaging app

No Video Recording

No Voice Dialing

No MMS

No 3G



Well done Apple, that's a nice looking er..'thing' you have.

Well, I'm no big fan of Nokia either, i hate Nokia phones, their designs suck bigtime.



I think the iPhone design is not bad, but not exactly new, I mean c'mon.. And all that hype by the Apple presentation eh? the ol' jeans and cardigan show eh? I mean d'you see Sony or Philips do anything like that? c'mon what's the big fuss all about? it's just a phone. The hype isn't neccessary, as any good product will justify itself. Although it's understandable that if this model doesn't make it, the next one will not gain enough trust.
hey can some one tell me if this allows you to attach files with an email i am interested in this phone only if it allows you as i am spoiled by the blackberry, so please if some one have this phone please let us know thanks.

this phone is not upto the expectations there are more phones better than this to n93 or n91 is best than this worst phone
700,000 sets were sold in FIRST week. That's a record. Gotta try it to see how it works. I think still early days of iPhone although it got a lot of popularity before the launch.
I'm still waiting for the IRACK
Will this phone work with other GSM providers??  Will this work in INDIA?????
No, MMS?  Its a basic feature to have in a phone.
It is simple I generate an expectation that could not cover.



he is not the best smartphone, not even a good smartphone.it has many deficiencies
to Patrick Seehanach :

Dear Patrick, Do you mean we are too stupid to see this iphone is fantastic ? Let us say, we are smart enough to see behind the marketing and realise it isnï¿½t. compared to latest Nokia, Samsung, SE,..... mobiles it looks poor. Anyhow whatever, this forum is there to review mobiles, not to tell people they are too stupid to understand what PP ( perfect patrick ) means.
If apple made an ipod that can make calls, ok with it. If apple wanted to build a mobile , than they failed over the whole line. Really not smart from apple to enter the market of mobiles without any knowledge. Nokia, SE, Samsung.....feel safe, this will never beat your devices.
I think its not worth it no 3g and some told me  if your useing the web u can get calls
yo anyone know when they will let the second release happen?? I want the phone but can't get it anywhere;; they're all goneawesome phone! the jimi hendrix of the 21st  century! :)
main selling point was the MAC OS X and the apple brand :)
8gig MicroSD?



And, how much, pray-tel,  would that cost? And, how many phones have an OS that will support such a card? How many people use so much memory.



In my opinion, and it's just that, only Sony and Apple have good music players. So, get a Sony or Apple if you like music. If it's a killer phone - maybe Nokia is O.K. But, not all Nokia unlocked phones work well with US carriers. So, be careful.



I have purchased the iPhone. It has some cool features and some things that are lacking. For my needs it's O.K.



what phone in the world have a 8G memory card?



Samsung has just developed an 8gig MicroSD... Put it in your nokia and bang, youve got an iPhone killer... If storage is all your worried about..
People are getting crazy over iphone simply because of advertisment. If you want excellent sound quality for your music, SE W960 would be a better choice. SE W960 also has huge internal memory (8GB), Wi-fi connection,  and touchscreen.
what is wrong with all you haters or lovers of the iphone. it's just a toy, are u all back to your kindergarten days?

for the bucks, macbook is a better value.
well,,I think it's just copy of other phone.But the most problem is that "IF YOU DON'T REGISTER THE AT&T IT WON'T WORK NITHER OTHER COUNTRYS" & "IT CAN'T RECORDING VIDEO" they most be kidding us!!!after all the reason of the sold like that was the name of company(APPLE)
iphone is the next generation ... as for the rest of the phones steve jobes describes them very well



"The products suck! There's no sex in them anymore!"  ...



take a second and think about that
To let everyone know about the iphone battery,



The battery is this device is soldered on the device and cannot be removed or changed by the owner.  You have to send it to Apple and have them replace the battery for you.  To replace the battery costs $79 plus $6.99 for shipping.  and will take 3 business days to do it. Also, Apple will offer a loaner iphone for $2.99 while yours is at the shop.

Its obviously better!
does the ipod support avi format?? NO.. so the iphone wont either
this phone is a angel!!!

8 gb, 2 pm, wfi
Salam You help mobile to me confuse yes

Nadeem ahmed deaf
so, who needs anymore card-slot, if the memory of tis phone reaches to 8G???what phone in the world have a 8G memory card?iphone supports java or other application...and it's a fancy phone as well.more good looking than Prada & Co.and the OS X is simply amazig...
It is an iPod with phone features slapped onto it with few other nice amenities; like video being the amenity in the 5th gen iPod.

But i'll wait for the 6th gen iPod.
jozefe bergomi: No it wont. It is SIM-locked to the AT&T/Cingular network. So the security needs to be cracked first and it is not (yet).
hi there ,if you buy a iphone in US and bring it to japan,it will works there, all you must do is register it in japan,in some country the registeration is free but in other you must pay for it,the mony that you pay is very low,so no prob ,yu should go for it!
This is Apple's first try! It's a very good first try (in my opinion). There are other phones with more features. But none had a start like this. And, most copied each other.
I keep seeing post that request a GSM Arena review. Hmm, there are many honest reviews on the Internet that I've read. Also, GSM Arena will have to test it in the US and only with AT&T.
I have a Blackberry 8800 with T-Mobile. It works without failure.



I just got the iPhone (Could not help myself :-)) The signal is clear and load in my area, just as good as any other phone I've used with GSM. A bit over priced; but remember a 8GB Nano is 250.00; and the price has remained the same. So, I don't expect Apple to lower the price of the iPhone for a while.I think the iphone is really cool with great interface and design. The design is a bit better than n95 but if i was 2 choose between iphone and n95, i'd buy the n95(which i did btw). I'd eventually get bored with just d looks but the features wud keep me goin. Atleast i can install 3rd party apps on my n95(both symbian and java)

Btw why is a big software like apple botherd with security issues tht they ddnt put java capabilities in d iphone.

So with a 2years contract on AT&t u end up spending $2000. With the current technological advancements at dat time dat kind of money can probably gt u a phone with 15GB+ and 10mpix+ cam.



Im nt a se fan but i think w960 is also waay better in terms of features. Atleast its gt 3mpix cam,  8GB, symbian and its touchscreen.



Im nt against apple, infact i love all their products except iphone. If they released an iphone with atleast the following 3Mpix cam, cif or vga video recording, 3G, java and add more features 2 d bluetooth, then i wud buy one.



Its marrying a woman for her great looks, really big boobs and butt and rilly great sex but no personality at all. How long d u think it'll take b4 u gt bores with ha and start cheating.... Think bout it
A real competitor of Nokia and Sony Ericsson, it will absolutely brak their monopoly.t...., but the price should be more lower than the present to make it affordable for more people.  ASAD

How much true it is then? 99%? 50%? 10%? That reply implies that the functionality is not easily accessible.



>> Then:

Translation: a feature that you find as default in pretty much any other phone is not available on this phone. Oh yeah, and you will have to pay for it, never mind you get it free in the other phones.



>> Then:

>> "No Keyboard, No spell check,"

> It has both.



Bluetooth does not support an external keyboard, it seems like the phone supports headsets only. If that is the case, well, doh!



>> Then:

>> "No Games,"

> It's a matter of time and requests.



Translation: half assed support for games. All other phones come preloaded with some games and you can download many now, not some indeterminate time in the future.



>> Then:

>> "doesn't support JAVA,"

> That is a security issue. So, get over that.

> Apple fans don't want the woes of Microsoft.



That is the most idiotic thing said on the comment I am replying to. Java has never been a major security issue. Java programs have to run in a thing called a virtual machine, which makes it very difficult to access basic functions in the phone. Java was designed from the ground up with security as one of its main features. Who wrote that comment  simply does not know what he is talking about



>> Then:

>> "Can't do Custom ringtones,"

> Those are coming from Apple iin the first update.



Translation: not available. Ringtones. For a phone. No further comment frankly.
Java a security issue? That is the lamest excuse not to include Java.



What nonsense. Java is used in banks to run complex financial transactions and is designed from the ground up to be secure (programs are "sandboxed" which means they can't interact with the operating system in the machine, in this case the phone).



If Java is good for banks  it is good for a little tiny phone.
Don't buy this phone from the sharks on eBay!



Most Apple Stores are getting them daily (I went to the Apple Store and got my second today); it's only a few days to have one delivered. Also, the AT&T Stores are starting to get them again.
yeah... that's true and the price a little expensive...
camera on this phone is bad...it can't zoom and doesn't have video camera
I am an Apple fan, but this phone is not what I expected... it sucks, really!!
great design, first generation phones always bad
OMG!!!!! that is the best phone ever (i think). ive seen the thing on a website.
MAC OS developers should provide users a video recording program that records @ minimum of QVGA @ 30Fps.
Does anyone know if this phone has any type of document viewer?  If not do you know any good phones that do?
The Nokia n95 and e90 support an 8gb card coming out very soon....already support a 4gb card
what are you complaining

abouuut! ,, really you have

worse phoness ..of other brands

and then you get this great

phone of course is not flawless

but still ,, in a few months

you won't even care about it,!

what else do you want?. there's

really nothing youu can do, ï¿½ï¿½
Ive been playing with the new phone for about a week. very mixed feelings. i give an A for concept and design.  functionality has a lot to be desired.  the icons at start-up are misleading. these are not the programs you might expect. they are web based widgets which perform only some of the program features. iCal example. its nothing more than a simple calendar. it is very locked, you cant even down load a web page to a document reader. it is a cool ipod. ive seen blogs describing the development of the device but until it matures, i say hold off.
ok ppl lets talk... i work for the company that services the iphone(AT&T).  ok first of all im not saying that this phone is complete garbage, im saying that this phone isnt what everyone makes it out to be. it doesnt have a camera at all, the sim is not changable, there is no MMS, limited 3rd party programs, non expandable memory, and only edge on a phone that boost on its internet??? this phone is not worth the total monthly and outright in comparison to the S.E. W960i or the N95 which yea you will spend more outright for the phone but monthy its cheaper and you can do so much more!!! oh and by the way there is no stero bluetooth(A2DP) on a phone that also boost on its music!!! please feel free to tell me what you think about what i said...
Someone wrote:

"This doesn't have MMS capability,"

That is not 100% true. It can receive an MMS. If people understood this feature, they'd know how it's possible.



Then:

"NO video capture - ONLY playback,"

True. But, Apple has approved certain programmers to add features. So, it's a matter of time and requests for such a feature.



Then:

"No Keyboard, No spell check,"

It has both.



Then:

"No Games,"

It's a matter of time and requests.



Then:

"doesn't support JAVA,"

That is a security issue. So, get over that. Apple fans don't want the woes of Microsoft.

Those are coming from Apple iin the first update.
This doesn't have MMS capability,NO video capture - ONLY playback, No Keyboard, No spell check, No Games, doesn't support JAVA,

Can't do Custom ringtones, Internet is only edge - wich is consider dial up(sucks). I think this phone is not worth 500 or 600. Maybe $50 bucks to help apple. =P
so any how when will this phone reach the middle east, and what's the deal with it not supporting MMS ?



and it costs about $499 ,thats the retail of the 8gb or 4gb ?
911,

Are sure you are not on Apple pay cheque.Hahaha!Sorry i mean can it be used in Singapore :)
hmm can the Iphone be used in Asia ? I mean does it support the GSM network?
to MIKEFMV:

in europe not work, becouse is sim lock
Think what is that great about it??
Itï¿½s also the best phone that anybody has ever made,ï¿½ says Lev Gossman (Time). ï¿½The user interface,ï¿½ Grossman marvels, ï¿½is crammed with smart little touches ï¿½ every moment of user interaction has been quietly stage-managed and orchestrated, with such overwhelming attention to detail that when the history of digital interface design is written, whoever managed this project at Apple will be hailed as a Michelangelo, and the iPhone his or her Sistine Chapel.ï¿½
It only took two minues (at the most) to get the iPhone to use the wireless WiFi on my Apple Powerbook. Got to love it! :-)



Used it today at a cafï¿½ with free WiFi. Connected immediately! Got to love that too!
Leo Laporte, one of the most respected tech experts for the PC and Macintosh in the US, has said he was cynical about the hype of the iPhone before it came out. But once he used it, he says it's great and Apple has delivered as promised. He gives it a high rating.



So, go to:



http://www.leoville.com/


You can learn what he advises on his national radio show and television programs with regards to PCs and Macs.

Don't by the phone in eBay at high prices. The guys on eBay are selling phones like a scalper sells tickets. The phones are available at Apple and AT&T:

Availability:



http://www.apple.com/retail/iphone/


The SIM Card will come out and can be changed.

User Manual:

And, there is inscurance for the phone.



http://www.apple.com/support/i...service/faq/


It will send and receive MMS. You have to understand what they really are. Contact either T-Mobile or AT&T for GSM instructions on MMS.



Don't listen to the lies about the iPhone. It's a nice phone and will do many things people are saying it won't!

sure you can use the phone in Canada, as long as you don't mind paying for roaming.  I heard Rogers will be carrying it in the near future, so you should probably wait.



I have to agree with a few of you that this has to be by far one of the best phone I have used thus far.  It is completely intuitive and no need for a instruction.
how do you change out the sim card
Dear jELP,

u said some of features will not available if use iphone with other SIM cards than AT&T.

1- The Apple stuff theirselves told that to u?

2- What r these exact features?



Thanks
WOW ... goodbey N95 ...

I have owned the treo 750, the nokia n95 and other smartphones and the iphone beats them all easily.  It is super easy to use and not as expensive as the n95.  It was worth buying it, even if a better version comes out soon.
the iphone for me is still premature...id say hold on til apple release their next version of the iphone....



apple is such a clever company... they just want you to buy the iphone then if they think its no longer selling, they would release the updated version- a better 1..just like with my experience with ipods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, i bought ipod mini thinking, ipod mini wud b the smallest they can get an mp3 can be, then afterwards releasing the nano which is smaller! so i got to buy again....



SO GUYS THINK ABOUT IT before you buy.
hi ya, live in south africa, wanna know if i can use the phone here, wanna order it so bad, gotta love the phone. plse refer to my name (vortex) when aswering tks
the apple iPhone is no where near as the nokia n95 the bluetooth only supports headset interaction its way overpriced it has an obismal 2 megapixel camera which is now pretty standard plus it has no GPS and also no 3g let alone the HSDPA broadband the n95 has software issues but the new nokia n95 tvedition will has all problems resolved
to dareath, how did you change out the sim card?
Also, to add to the post below. I urge all interested to get the iPhone and play with it. You have 14 days to return the phone to the store and cancel 2 year agreement with AT&T. You will be charged 10% restocking fee, so it will cost you $50 or $60 depending on the version you get. I think it is fare price to be able to play with it for 2 weeks.
I have purchased iPhone on its second day of release, so by now had played with it for a while. This is the best mobile phone I have ever had. The ability to look at web pages the way they intended to be, with zoom in and out is unprecedented. Also having 3.5 inch screen in your pocket to watch any movies is phenomenal considering this is the same device from which phone calls are made. Yahoo, Gmail ï¿½ works great.



There is an issue with setting up exchange for corporate servers, but I think it will be solved within a year, and then this ï¿½toyï¿½ will become heavily used by business. All my coworkers said they would give up blackberry in a heartbeat the moment iPhone would work with corporate e-mail servers.



It is thin enough to carry in a pocket along with wallet.



Yes, it has shortcoming such as, 2mp camera, no video camera, edge (which works very decently, to my surprise), no games, no IM.



But all these shortcomings will be taken care in the near future. Meanwhile, I am totally enjoying the phone.

Can I use this phone in Canada?C'mon people...Stop comparing this iphone with other phones. Apple has taken the 1st step of developing and coming up with a phone in their product line. And yet, its so impresseive. They atleast came up with something new that no other phone had.



I love the Sony ericsson and Nokia models but Iphone is somethin unique..Appereciate their efforts! :)
Check this out

all the reasons why the iPhone sucks
I had Iphone about 3 days ago, and i return it after 1 day..Nice phone, Internet is perfect and most of think good, But, im sure every person need and love use Bluetooth and MMS on this days..This phone is missing Regular Bluetooth, and you cant send and receive MMS..I paid 599.99 and also battery was bad..If you use Internet 1-2 hours a day, the battery will die very quick, but Razr v3xx, you can use full day and battery still full..Maybe Apple need Upgrade this phone..
Somewhere is a consumer looking at the Apple iPhone in an Apple store. They have always admired this phone and wished to get one. They like the beauty and simplicity; It does what they need. Upon announcing their intention to get it, they are advised by a freind, family member, colleague, or significant other, not to get it as there are much better phones for the price. So, they are told about the 'Belchfire-2000' model with the turbo charged WiFi, 200 giga-pixel camera, DNA reader, and on-the-go breathalyzer.



While sitting in STARBUCKS with the manual the size of War and Peace, they notice someone at an adjacent table sporting the iPhone. They look at their Belchfire-200 and the voluminous tome of a manual and sigh; tears begin to well up in their eyes...



Get the point? If you like it, have always wanted it, get one. Don't get a phone someone else wants. It may do lots of things; but if the iPhone does what you want, then it's a good phone for you. And it is, in fact, pretty cool. And if you don't like it, you can always return it.
"I want to get the iPhone."

"No, get the N95, it's better."

"But, I really want the iPhone."

"No, get the N95, it does more."

"But, I like the design and innovation of the iPhone."

"It's just hype, get the N95."

"Really, I've always wanted the iPhone."

"Don't get it, it's stupid."

"But, I think it's cool."

"That's 'cause you're stupid!"



Seriously, if you like the iPhone and it does what you want, don't listen to the ramblings of the naysayers. The iPhone is a nice phone. Yes, it could have done more. But, if it does what you want and you like it...get it.

Sounds like a comment from a disgruntled worker who is not a stockholder. What you describe happens in businesses of all sizes, whether public or private. Business is about making a profit, not satisfying every whiner on the planet.



The iPhone is cool; for the most part, it's a good pretty good phone.



Also, read iCreate Magazine and see where Apple has licensed certain ventors to program applications. It's a matter of security and trust.
yes osx is far better than symbian.Take your average series 60 symbian,you need to install  ill thought out programs just to try and stop your phone from running out of RAM  and rebooting.It seems you need to install a 3rd party application to pick your nose with the s60 range!lol

Oh enlightened one, please educate the rest of us and explain to the class what is a MMS.
This phone is... very interesting.

Nice design, nice display, nice user interface.

But then... It's a bit confusing in parts. The navigation aspect is quite poor, actually.

And come on... I can't send files via bluetooth! That's just dumb.

I'm not getting this phone. It's just a phone with full of hype.
What a collection of anti-Apple luddites at this GSMarena forum! Does it hurt to see innovation and success of others?
wonderfull.first time in my life company create a (apple) iphone.i dont know how much funcations to in side.but i know mobile shape is very beautiful.mobile waite is normal.not for very havey.i dont know how much cast of this mobile.i am request for guyes.plz tell me how much cast of this mobile.for pin pack.take care.every body.bye.
take comparison of this phone with SE w960

symbian is outdated my friend...this is the future we see here...
By reading this phones specification and manuals, I really thought  that  it was a second-rate product. I mean for a company like Apple to release a new product would mean it is a top class and suitable! and Yes it is good looking and has 15million colours, but on the contrary it just doesnï¿½t give enough. I would more rather prefer a phone that has the standard functions like 3G, or radios etc, therefore if this phone cant provide that it is just lame! Not only that but it is really disappointing to know that, users will have to rely on slow 2.5G EDGE to download music, videos and movies!

hi this is a gr8 ph. i wnt to buy this asap.

But can any one tell me can we use this one in India as well.
People say it's over priced. No way! I paid 4,500 on eBay and think it's wrorth every penny. ;-)



Serious, don't buy them from the scalpers or sharks on eBay. They are in stock and available at Apple or AT&T!
There is a slot at the top of the phone to remove installed sim (like treo 650) thought it is pointless to change it out because the imei is locked to the sim card.  Must have 2yr contract + iphone data plan with att in order to use it.  No way around yet.
someone said the ability to zoom in and out and look at real web pages is unprecedented.



i have to say you are not familiar with the real cell phone market.



iphone's interface is amazing: many of my american friends have showed it off to me. 10/10 , A+ for presentation.



feature wise? not worth the price tag.

it's more of a status symbol than functional.



camera, gps, HSDPA, all are lacking.

Translation: a feature that you find as default in pretty much any other phone is not available on this phone. Oh yeah, and you will have to pay for it, never mind you get it free in the other phones.

Bluetooth does not support an external keyboard, it seems like the phone supports headsets only. If that is the case, well, doh!

That is the most idiotic thing said on the comment I am replying to. Java has never been a major security issue. Java programs have to run in a thing called a virtual machine, which makes it very difficult to access basic functions in the phone. Java was designed from the ground up with security as one of its main features. Who wrote that comment simply does not know what he is talking about



>> Then:

Translation: not available. Ringtones. For a phone. No further comment frankly.



------> gotta love the apple iphone...HAHAHA!
I listen to the Tom Lycos radio show. He said that if I got one I'd have more dates. Wow, it's true; my iCalendar is full now. Thanks Tom. ;-)



Seriously, it's a cool phone. Easy to use and it works just the way Apple advertised. Get one, if you don't like it...return it.According to David Needle (internetnews.com), customers of NetSuiteï¿½s ï¿½on-demand, integrated business management applicationsï¿½ are already using iPhone to take advantage of its web-based services. It was ï¿½Apple putting Safari on the iPhone [that] made it a simple processï¿½ for the company to extend service to iPhone customers, says Sean Rollings, NetSuiteï¿½s senior director of product marketing. Using the built-in Safari browser, says Rollings, ï¿½ ï¿½salespeople will be able to get a lot of their work done on an iPhone. You have the ability to check inventory for the availability of a product and get an answer in real time.ï¿½ï¿½
the iphone is the greatest phone ever.

i cant understand why you dont like it, if i lived in usa i would buy it right away

the iphone fkn rocksssss!!!!!!!
this phone is athe most revolutionized phone out today it is amazing
when will you ppl understand....its not how good the phone is its how different it is....i mean its all touch screen....theres only one friggin button......its the experience of it not how good the fone is...



answer this question...would you buy a wii or ps3???

most ppl will say wii because of how you play the wii. you acutally move. i think the wii graphics suks but still....theres more to it than just sitting there with a controller in your hand and your just exercising your fingers



if the iphone didnt have this big of a touch screen i would say it suks ballz but the user interface is just really nice...think about it
Someone asked:

I have had my Iphone for about 2 weeks.  I love it.  The google search feature is wonderful.  It is like having a 400 dollar vehicle map gps unit in the palm of your hand.  Or Literally the power of Google in your pocket.  I like the simplicity of it. The safari browser is great!!  Getting voicemail as a list so I can pick the ones I want to hear first and delete the ones I don't.  An Ipod music on the go.   Merging calls easily and alot I have not found out,... YET. DONT LISTEN TO THE BASHERS!!! THIS PHONE ROCKS!! i CHALLENGE YOU TO TRY ONE AND THEN KNOCK IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This phone is a best elect for me , that am a computer student...

I like I phone , because is a phone that lunch 5 years sooner...!
man i hv bought dis phone .its jus a fabulous one .luvvvv dis cell ...
No 3G, Battery power keep only 8-9- hours and done..No regular Bluetooth, no MMS, No Video recording, and you have to make new 2 years contract with New sim card, and your voice mail will change to Iphone special voicemail..This is all for me problem and headache. I Return it 2nd day..But i cant say bad or good..You have to go store and ask them allot of questions before you buy..
This phone is so good I would make love to it if I could. I've tried, unsucessfully. My fiancee understands. The camera and screen are apple-worthy. Its incredibly intuitive. Its almost rediculously priced, despite how Steve Jobs breaks it down. But it performs as much as it is aesthetically pleasing.

$60 /month plan is what I pay now for my regular cell bill w/o data. Good buy overall despite any critics.
Hi,I am very interested with this mobile phone.Can some one tell about it???Does it has a good camera,is there 3G,how is the battery life and how frigile it can be.Also,how many year it can go???Thankx in advance
Well, this place used to be a good place for reviews, but h*ll with this... you guys don't know sh*t about writing a review... if you want a phone then just buy it, experience it and the write a review if you find a factory default or any dissappointments.. but without havin one!!  Anyway, apple is innovative atleast in multimedia... adioz
I don't see what relevance arguing the existence of the iphone actually accomplishes!

It is a great product that is revolutionizing the way the current mobile market operates. We don't have them in Canada yet, but it is easy to see the business case develop. This phone is much more than a phone, its the beginning of a resurgence in the industry.

This is a very simple case of supply and demand on two sides. The phone and the service provider have come together to place a niche product in the hands of customers whom are frequently changing phones and service providers. They have taken the unlocking power out of the hands of code-artists by implying the possibility of re-locking via software updates. They have supported a profit system that is two-way, whereby producer and provider share profits. Thirdly, and most importantly, they have created a total product evidenced by lineups across America that people actually want.

If you are wondering if you need one, you probably don't...yet. However, this is the way the market is moving. You will own an iphone or something very similar to it someday. Stop hating on innovation (yes, it is innovation regardless of how you truly feel about the iphone &/or AT&T). It is because of visionaries, like Jobs, Gates, Rogers, etc... we even have the products we do.
I mean, is there a place to insert ur sim card or is it built-in?itt does uses samsung modules! what do u think nokia produces its own?it also has modules of toshiba go checkout your n95 open it out and you will find out

Owners Overwhelmingly Happy with iPhone



ï¿½iPhone buyers have no regrets,ï¿½ says Edward C. Baig (USA Today). Baig spoke with Jason Kramer, the chief strategy officer of Interpret, a market research firm that conducted a survey of recent iPhone purchasers. The study found that ï¿½90% of 200 owners said they were ï¿½extremelyï¿½ or ï¿½veryï¿½ satisfied with their phone. And 85% said they are ï¿½extremelyï¿½ or ï¿½veryï¿½ likely to recommend the device to others.ï¿½ The findings, says Kramer ï¿½are ï¿½pretty much off the charts.ï¿½ï¿½
The Most Successful Product Intro of the 21st Century



ï¿½Appleï¿½s iPhone could emerge as the most successful product introduction of the 21st century, new research suggests.ï¿½ Conducted by Lightspeed Research, ï¿½the research findings are staggering,ï¿½ reports Jonny Evans (Macworld). ï¿½Nearly 90 percentï¿½ of the respondents had heard about iPhone, and 32% of those who didnï¿½t already own one intend to purchase one. In a separate survey, Lightspeed Research also learned that ï¿½nearly half of those who would like to own an iPhone stated that the benefits of having music, movie, internet and wireless all in one was the top reason.ï¿½

"The reason why people are going crazy about the phone is -

1: Most people in America are not exposed to nice foreign phones; cell phone services usually distribute phones used by foreign consumers years ago."



A. I go to Europe about three times each year. I have numerous unlocked phones. In any case, I still purchased the iPhone. B. Euro mobile phones, although more advanced in some models, don't always work correctly on US networks. So, that's a big risk. C. The GSM phones in Europe are generally only a year ahead - not two. D. Comp USA carries a wide variety of impressive unlocked phones from Nokia; they don't sell well. E. Sony Ericsson sells many of the latest unlocked phones in the US; they don't sell well. F. Europeans want this phone too.



"2: It's greatly advertised."



A. If that's the solution, then it would be wise for the other manufactures to advertise; but they don't. It's not that simple.



" 3: It's made from Apple. Because people think their laptops and computers are nice, they expect the same thing from the phone."



A. This would only be true if the majority of the purchasers were consumers that use Apple computers. That is not what is happening; Windows users are purchasing iPhone in a larger majority (read the reports). B. And again, many people in Europe are awaiting the release of iPhone as well.
it has like bad pictures
The reason why people are going crazy about the phone is

number 1

most people in America are not exposed to nice foreign phones, cell phone services usually distributes phones used my foreign consumers years ago

number 2

its greatly advertised

number 3

its made from apple. Because people think their laptops and computers are nice, they expect the same thing from the phone
is there a flash in the phone camera? and does it really lack 3g??
This phone have got sucky features.. i wonder why people went to sought it out despite knowing its specs.. e beauty itself doesnt worth the price we are paying.. stupid handset.. wish Apple could come out with something smarter and nicer not some bimbo phoneS
i really liked this phone but no memory card slot, cant replace battery freely, expensive data plan sucks for having edge slow internet, getting stuck internet frequently, camera sucks, have to email yourself or someone else pictures, cant upload to computer or use memory card to transfer, not worth the money, unless someone can tell me otherwise
battery sucks whats the point">???????????

Please put your thinking cap on before coming to class. If you'd paid attention to what I was commenting on you would have deduced - my dear Watson - it was about manufactures initially giving exclusive rights to carriers in the USA. Canada, Rogers,

http://www.rwireless.ca/,
unless something has changed, is not in the US.



With regards to T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verison (US carriers), they don't have it. And, as far as I know, AT&T was the first exclusive carrier of the Curve. If I'm wrong, please educate us. And unlocked phone, and/or a subcontractor reselling service is not the same.



And as to the personal (ad Hominem) attacks and red herrings you introduce. Argue the issues of the iPhone - if you can. ;-)

And stop posting all this stuff with dumb names...be a human being and use your name...the iphone is gud. we bought one few days bak bt the only thing i dont like about it is that it doesnot work in pakistan. its price is also gud 600$ bt its memory should have been atleast 20GB. 8BG is very less. overall i lyk this phone, especially its design
does it work in dubi. or just AT&T.
I brought two Iphones online the day they came out. I finally received mine a few days ago. Well, I liked it, but I decided to keep my other phone and gave my mom the one I had opened. The Iphone is ok, but not the best. I am a keyboard, games,and 3G man. I would much prefer to buy the next iphone that comes out with more features and maybe even a keyboard. The phone that I currently have already does what the iphone can do. So IT'S OK, I just want something BETTER.
Please i read at APPLE that the Iphone may not work with another simcard. May, i repeat, what do you understand?

What a dud.  No 3G, No MMS, Crap camera?  Come on people!!  This fails on all fronts except the noice UI and brand front.......But hey thats all people need then go for it. Will wait and see.
IT's world best phone other phone sucks in front of this

I think this phone is sooooooo sexy.

It reminds me of SEAN MC CLAREN

Big ,Stylish , and sooooo sexy

and easy too use
Greetings from Los Angeles!!!  I don't know what you guys are talking about the iphone not being able to connect to a car via blue tooth.  I have one and it does connect to my 5 series BMW just fine.  Internet browsing is a little slow but overall awesome phone.  Google maps is amazing and so is the yahoo weather.  I've had everything from a n95 to lg prada and the iphone is still one of a kind!!!
Ok lets decide on how to categorize this phone before we judge it.



It's not a smart phone by any means.

I think it's an excellent phone for entertainment period. nothing more nothing less.

Tell me one  thing inovative about it beside having the name APPLE.



My comments about the blue tooth came from an ATT salesperson who claimed that it only support a headset. He said it does not pair with a car blue tooth. Is that true? has anybody tried it?



Ok I think you all should check the real smart phone by Eten Glofiish x800.
I think that you all save your mony and keep your old phone. They play mp4, mp3, 3gp, and all good things. Also most imprtent they have bluetooth ;)
please reconsider your plan to buy this phone. It does looks amazing but after you buy it you'll regret it. maybe next time when they make a better one, not today, it tooks time for apple to make their phone product into perfection. some important feature missing, and it is not a productive phone like other, it is a consumtive phone that will crush your bank account when you realize it...
EDIT:



Even on the apple site they say that iphone supports bluetooth!

A trademark logo of bluetooth and it says:

Instandly connect to the iphone headset and !other bluetooth devices!.



I dont know what to think anymore...
Why does everybody says the iphone has no bluetooth while gsmarena.com says it does, yes only with headsets but that is the same as a carkit or a handsfree set.



What does headset only mean exacly?



Hopefully by the time the iphone get to europe they change the sim card support so i can use my old one with my own number.
this phone will be another expensive failure it hasnt got Bluetooth text messaging will be near enough impossible and it hasnt even got video recording yes its got video player but whats the point if u carnt bluetooth videos to the phone and u will have to wait till u get home to put music on to it all in all rubbish give me the n95i anyday
Why do you spread lies? Yes you can change the SIM. No you can't change the battery (like an iPod) but Apple will change it for you, it has 10 days battery life in standby (how can that be poor??), it doesn't have a memory slot but it has 4 and 8 GB of internal memory by default , the Bluetooth is 2.0+EDR (how can it be primitive??), it also has multitouch, rich html browser W3C compliant based on the Webkit/KHTML core with full standards support including AJAX, Web2.0, Acid3 CSS compliant, rich html email client with IMAP, POP3, Push email,, accelerometer, integrated ipod, wifi, visual voice mail, native core image support, 8.9cm screen with 320ï¿½480 pixels at 160 ppi, ical sync, itunes sync, reader plugins for pdf, word and excel documents, iphoto sync, Google services integration, free exclusive yahoo IMAP push email support, etc, etc etc.
Iphone...comparing apples and oranges.

For questions on buying the iphone and shipping it to another country...unlocking it...is it possible, is it doable?

Easily.

Once you've found the sim, the biggest hurdle you need to go through is activating it through their website. There are sites/tutorials as to how to go about this part. Truth be told, its rather easy and probably some would term it as an elementary type of fraud. Ask your MMORPG friends who have activated an account with an U.S. address and a generic social insurance number...

But shipping it overseas? hell no...probably the most idiotic idea one could ever think of.

The biggest "selling" factor the iphone has, compared to other phones (aside from the bling factor), is its cell plan; its unlimited data rate. That is the best the phone could offer!

Most data rates, go about 3-5c per kb. The iphone on the other hand, has unlimitted data rate; for a heavy email/surf user, this is definitely the best selling point for the phone-and for anyone with logic.

Another big selling point for the phone is its youtube player-most pda phones or phones of that level fail to accomplish this.

The reason is rather simple; no codec that decodes/read flv (flash video-this is the format most videos are streamed in the internet-there are 3 other emerging streams that are used though; wmv; for tv stations; mov for apple, and the newest one that is used by divx).

There are a few downsides to it though, the 3g, the camera,phone tones, etc; (compared to higher end phones i.e. p1, and e90) the iphone is left by a mile.

Although the other alternatives may be more expensive, it all boils down to this, you get what you pay for, and for the iphone, its a glorified ipod.

But speculators and rumor has it that the reason why this iphone is so lacking in phone technology and capability is probably summed up in two words-target market.

This phone targets the United States, phones in this country are quite behind compared to the u.k. and asia. Its BIGGEST competitor in this market is the blackberry-we all know how blackberry is so shunned in u.k. and asia, and for a phone whose use is mainly its email/web access, the iphone just massacres it.

So if your from these markets (u.k., asia, etc), just wait for the iphone aimed at your demographic. From the news going around-the next release will include a better camera, 3g capability, and so on and so forth, a stronger and fiestier phone compared to this one they've released-which is mostly the case for any 1st gen phone or electronic.

So, to sum up, for the blackberry user, buy the iphone, for the asian/uk market, get the e90, or wait for the iphone 2 this december.



I think there was no space left in the phone for bluetooth. It is just an another i pod with a touch screen phone features but not all. Just a piece of crap w/o bluetooth.
well I still think after certain number charges and discharges the battery will and the phone will go dead.



this phone does not pair with any car blue tooth.



this phone does not support 3G.

this phone is only a toy to enjoy for few days.



mark my word Apple will fix everything I said very soon exept the replacable battery.
"this phone has many drawbacks.

first it's only avaialable through ATT.

You can't change the SIM, it's part of the phone.

You can't change the battery, when it's dead you trash your phone.

it's blue tooth is primitive.

it does not have 3G.

it's easy to drop."



- Many phones are only through AT&T.

- You can change the SIM - go to Apple for directions.

- On Apple's site it explains the battery. I will last all day, unless you are staring at the screen constantly and have it set wrong.

- Look at the PC magazine video review on You Tube. It's almost indestructable. So, drop it and don't worry.
I thought I said "FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW" I DID NOT say for those of you who THINK they know, because apparently people you CAN in fact use your i-Phone SIMless yes you heard me right, WITHOUT a SIM card, and here is my proof:



http://www.cnettv.com/9710-1_53-28180.htmlI think the best thing about the iphone was its advertising i bought it used it for a week and went back to my nokia i61 now im trying to sell this stupid phone to get the i61 i
The Iphone is a PHONE. For those people who does not have the Iphone, Camera, Photo, Video, Mail, Safari, Maps, etc...These are all added features only and don't expect the Iphone to be a CAN OPENER or a HAIR DRYER.....
Nice fne n tht but the bluetooth is oni 4 the head and ppl like to send each utha things



hard t text off lol

Amen Jeff!!  iPhone is beautiful.  Best fashion phone ever!  But please please please please please warn all buyers : iPhones DO NOT HAVE cut/copy/paste.  So you can not use it for work.  All your emails & sms will be short & rude.
just dont get hurt about the comment if ur satisfied with it ok. this is a forum free opinion men.
@Matthieu Pesesse, there is already Nokia N91 with 8GB and great sound quality, and its available since early 2006.
HOW is the SMS to type is hard to write?

Before expressing your opinion regarding the Iphone, make sure that you tested the unit or you owned one. Stop saying negative things if you don't even have an Iphone. It's been a pleasure of having an IPHONE........
I've many friends with iPhone.  It's quite nice.  But please share one warning: the iPhone DOES NOT have cut&paste !!!!!  Please please warn everyone BEFORE they buy this phone.  No cut&paste cripples smartphone users !!!!!
The iPhone is absolutely worthless. There is no use for it. It is uncompatible with EVERYTHING... The only thing I know that is compatible with it is iTunes and related products of iTunes..

I'd recommend a Nokia N95 over it if you're looking for something fancy. If you're looking for simplicity, sporty, amazingness, great sharing, amazing web browser, GREAT Carl Zeiss 3.2MP Camera, I'd recommend the Nokia N73.. I have the N73 and my Dad has the N95.. I know what I'm talking about..
I am in U.K. and been reading comments and have come to a solution as to why 3g is ommited,,sum posts are saying 3g is in its infancy in america so apple chose not to use 3g yet as it may of not be of much use,,well here in U.K. we cant get fones that have proper tele recievers in but Italy and Germany do its because dvb-h is not coming to U.K. till 2012 so their is no point selling us them although they look really cool..I am not going to make any judgement yet till ive seen one working which is a while yet,,but from what ive seen what it does it does good,,its looks like really simple idea of super touchscreen that works so smoothly.In U.K. a lot are moaning at so many lack of basic fone features and maybe this may change for europe ? We are doing things different in U.K. to U.S. as according to our channel 5 gadget show push to talk is massive in U.S. but texting is unheard of where exactly the opposite here in U.K. with text messaging reaching millions a day.I still look forward to the i-phone its a gadget fone and us mobile obbssessives love new technology whatever it maybe so its still generating a buzz here in U.K.
Apple iPhone rocks it looks veryyyyyy

cool and it's an iPod In an CELL pHONE HOW GREAT IS THAT
The iPhone should be called the "iGasm"
hmmmmm, if I buy one I can not use the phone option - I have ipod with 80GB memory, i do not need usless phone - luckly we do not have at$t here.
I think the iPhone is just unreal. Its just not like the others. Its just simply beautiful. The software is so smooth and stable. Nokias and Sony Ericssons are so clunky and buggy. Ok you cannot Bluetooth photos. Who cares. All the people who claim to hate it are either burning to buy it or simply don't have taste. Do yourself a favor and just go out and buy one
great phone but a.t&t should not be the only company to launch apple... it should be worldwide.
what's all the commotion about - it looks crap!
People, you must understand the manupoliation of this iphone... it has a pre-set features that dominate the use of it. for example, it is pre-set to use google maps - no other GPS software options. It is preset to use Youtube, well it is great to use you tube on it, but can you configure the you tube to other website, why you tube, how they paid Appl? - there is no way to trasfere files from and into the phone unless you actuly coonect it to the compiter through a USB port! and use the provided software!

what about blue touth! infra read!



However, this nice machine is a great phone in usa, and a great expensive Ipod anywhere else.
Hei Iphone like Aple Ipod is a fashion gaget.

Like Ipode .. are many mp3 players cheaper and like Ipode but they don't have style.



So .. Iphone is a fashion phone !
you don't know anything mp in a camera it's about how big you are goin to post a photo the optical in i-phone are perfect and this phone works with the best software everI can't wait until this phone comes out in the uk

I hope there isn't going to a long que for it like there

was in america.
Amazing phone. Great job Mr Jobs!!
This is great.... The software that drives this phone is awesome. I wonder why the older phome manufacturers never came up with so much innovation? Well done Apple.
Hey, Guys! I read your opinion. Now im adressing to the owners of the iPHONE. Is it good or not? I have to admit that I was a little(ok, very very)dessapointed about the 3G.. Should I buy it? Please send me your opinion... thanks :)
Can anyone please confirm whether the iphone supports word document and excel spreadsheet viewing AND editing ? Also, does it support powerpoint presentations and PDF files ? (viewing only for these two).



Thanks in advance.
i think the iphone is great if it was released before nokia or sony or samsung had relreased their 2-megapixel cam-music-phones.there are hitech features of the iphone but the bottom line is that it is still a 2mp camphone, and not 3g at all. im not saying it is badly-designed but i agree with the other poster here that iphone's release is late. it should have been released in 2006. what's worse, it will only be released in asia in the late 2007 or early 2008.  nokia and other phone manufacturers are gearing up for a much better models when that time comes. anyway, good luck to all soon-to-be users of the iphone.
Someone said the audio level of the iPhone was low. What utter nonsense! I have two iPhones now. They are both the same and extremely loud as compared to my Samsung D500, Motorola Razor V3, and SE 750i. All these phones had low audio volume as compared to the iPhone. Sometimes I have to either hold the phone away from my ear, or turn it down it's so load. So, for the hearing impaired, it seems good.



Someone said the music quality was not good either. More lies, lies, lies; it's just as good as my iPod Nano.
Some of you need to a grip on yourselves...there is no 3G, no GPS, no memory slot, no games, not that I would play them anyway, no High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD), no open architecture pda software downloads, would not want to have sweaty palms when holding it! and talk time up to 8 hrs...yeah right! Seriously, what is all the ramping and raving about?
this is prob the best phone on the msarket in 2007 internet is fast email is great and the iphone ipod is the best one yet there is no doubt in my mind that it is the ggreatest phobne ever created
Why can't you have all 3 in 1 ? call, listen to and play, also work on a little device like this
good looking phone but lacks the features that is more functional n important.
I once owned an iPhone, but returned it after 2 days.

The only thing I really liked about it was the Internet browser, this was great!



But with Opera mobile 9 and Microsoft Deepfish soon to be released, it makes the iPhone browser look ordinary.



I now have the at&t 8525 (known as the HTC TyTN).



The issues with the iPhone were:

-The visual keyboard (too small),

-EDGE network (far to slow for such a nice browser),

-Contacts were hard to get to. (Scrolling was fun, but not really functional)

-Locked in applications...only Web based applications are allowed, no room for true growth.

-Camera with no features, not even zoom.

-Sound quality was too low, you could barely hear the person on the other end.



-Great iPod features.



in summary, it was a good "looking" phone. but not worth $600.00 for all that it lacked.

I found this link. It tells me there will be great things coming to this phone.





http://developer.apple.com/iphone/
I have written several reviews of phones that I feel are user friendly and by doing that I have recommended quite a few. This comment is not in any way geared towards the options or features available on the iphone. Personally I feel this innovation (even tho it was borrowed)is great but I would like those who are considering this or any other phone to follow their heart and not the opinions of anyone of us who review these smartphones. If all you care about on your phone is bluetooth capability then by all means get a phone that does that. Getting a $50 phone does not make you any less of a person than the individual who purchased the $500 iphone, Samsung, Sony Ericsson or any of the nokia N series (N93i,N95,N80,N91...). Your needs should drive your purchase and our opinions should only guide that future purchase.... have fun!
the i-phone is perfect!!!!  I think this phone is good look but it is very expensive!!!!
great fine i have 2 of them and cant live with out it

all my usage of music fone etc in 1 sweet lil device well done apple
ive heard so many bad reviews about the iphone. might as wel wait for the sony ericsson w960i, chk the spec, much better, plus better camera as well from a more trusted manufacturer. the iphone will be dated by the time its released. as someone previously stated for more recent nokia or sony phones the iphone is not worth a second look into. stick to the walkman brand of sony ericsson. for the person going to america to buy it, i hear you can only get it on a 2yr contract with the network AT&T or something like that.... its not worth the hassle. if u want it dat bad, just wait for the uk/europe release
So far, iPhone is the only phone that has super smooth and fast menu!
iPhone is the best dont sweat it...::...

Someone asked:

"will i-phone work in countries other than usa on a local network cos only at-t has rights for it ???"



This has been answered on the iPhone forum multiple times



People, pay attention and don't be lazy. There is a "Search Opinions" at the bottom of this pageï¿½us it!Before giving your opinion regarding the Iphone, make sure that you have the facts and also the most important thing of them all...that  you tested the phone.
n92. the solid phone. i got 1000 song so far in this phone. nice stereo. loud speaker.only 10 sec transfer a song from your pc to your phone. very fast. if u know much about the computer stuff. this phone is fabulous.but this baby is not cheap.it's worth to buy. you won't disappointed.
Don't spend money on this iphone.  It lacks many features of a simple regular phone. Ring volume is not loud enough. Its private option is too narrow. It sucks badly!
Btw, I crtiqued the iphone based on it as a multimedia device, if I has done that while considering it as a smartphone, as many have suggested it is, the list would be much longer...



sorry about the typos below, but im sure you can guess what I ment to say...
Guys, this phone was made for a certain demographic. It was made for the fashion consious and those who want to be "in".



That being said, the main focus of this phone has been placed on its GUI and for any of you who've used it know its probably the best in the industry, hands down. its construction is pretty solid as well. It has a gorgeous 3.5" screen that everyone around can envy. Video playback is the clearist i've seen on any phone and better than some dedicated PMPs.



What you guys need to understand is that this phone wasnï¿½t made to be a great technological achievement, only to seem like one. They pitched it as one and if you look at the demographic they've targeted, that group has completely believed it. Those people generally dont keep up with the current tech and therefore do not realize all the standard technologies that the iphone lacks.



The lack of stereo bluetooth on a multimedia device is just shameful...even mid-low range phones that cost $200 USD (w/o contract) have them, how could a premieum music phone north of 500 after 2/yr contract not?



And no video recording? EVERY phone with a camera offers this(albeit the quality is usally horrendious but its still there)



Although not a surprise given the ipod but a user replaceable battery is a very important option that travelers and heavy users NEED. Some people can afford to have a couple hours of down time just to wait for the phone to charge. And $80 plus installation to get it replaced? That must be a joke right? Who honestly would pay that?



They really shouldve offered removable storage as anyone who's used a pmp before that 8GBs fills up very fast when you store video. Oh btw, the iphone's OS takes up 700MB plus the fact that the manufacturing process is never acurrate means youre really only looking at either 3GB or 7GB of usable space depending on the model.



The recessed headphone jack is the dumbest idea in the world. What's the point of using a standaized plug if you apply it in a way that doesnt work with 80% of other headphones???



The camera is 2MP which is pretty decent, but with no autofocus it isnt even close to low end stand alone cameras.  Which means you're limited to casual snaps and for precious moments will still need a regular camera or your friends k810i :P And no flash means you'll only be taking those pics outdoors in the sun or in a really well lit room.



For the feature set, WLAN and web browser it's battery is drained within 3hrs using WiFi, and thats with the brightness set to low.  Thats not a whole lot of juice and with no replaceable battery you'll need to charge it back up. But if youre near a computer with which to charge it why would you be using the iphone to view websites??? does any of this make sense?



This phone is so rediculously similar to the LG Prada phone minus the storage space. FYI: is $500 USD w/o contract. And for all you Apple fanboys, the prada was winning awards for being the most innovative phone BEFORE apple even made an offical announcement of the iphone.



All in all, this is a good, if not great, phone, but it is well beyond over priced. And while it is a very capable device it is not very practical...the camera is far from impressive(no flash or AF), the battery is a let down(3hrs wifi and not replacable), 7GB(max) of space when your avg movie at optimal res for the iphone will be about 700-900MB(thats 7 movies about maybe 10 music albums), lack of usful headphone jack for your nice headphones(planned adapters from shure are $40 USD) and no stereo bluetooth make this a not so advanced device. But at least if your friends dont read up on forums like these they wont know the difference :)



Sorry so long, was trying to be thorough please feel free to respond(intellegently)
Widgets support makes phone slow !



phone is heavy it can never be compared wid Ipod---my 60gb ipod will beat this iphone



I made a great mistake by choosing this phone instead of N95
another one with touchscreen:



http://www.esato.com/news/article.php/id=1746
to be fair this phone has a few good or excellent feature but there are also many disappointing aspects of this phone. for example it has no card slots so that eliminates any way of exchanging data without using email or having to plug it into the computer, it also have no 3G which is extremely disappointing for a phone in this price range. the 2MP camera is acceptable. but the thing that annoys me the most is it can only be used for at&t and cingular. that prevents almost all the asian countries from using it to its full potential. But it us still the first phone apple have produced. hopefully their next one will be better
Well, I just couldn't help myself as I have tried so many other phones so I went out and bought and iPhone. I was in the US for a week so I said 'what the hxll'.  I signed up and tried everything.  I agree with most people that criticize this phone, it isn't everything to everyone.  But once you try it, you'll be in awe.  I haven't seen a better screen in my life and I have tried every phone out there.  (BTW, I brought with me a HTC Touch, N95, and the i600 just to compare - I'm a telco guy)  The iPhone does some things amazingly well.  The 'gyro' function is amazing - turn the phone sideways and it follows with Safari, iTunes, or when viewing photos.  Stunning.  Also, the interface is really fast.  Even the Nokia people I spoke to said the same.  I can't praise the features that it does have enough.  Yeah, it would fail as a smartphone though the "intelligent" predictive texting is quite smart.



One major downside I have found so far is that the phone itself didn't perform very well.  We had a really hard time hearing others (and vice versa) for a majority of our calls.



More importantly though, I believe the one major issue with the iPhone that I worry about is that the world may never get to see this phone.  Apple is adopting a different model than anyone else and is selling the phone directly through 1 operator in each market. So unless your local telecom company decides to pay Apple a big fee, then we may never get to see an iPhone in everyones hands.  The phone's been out a month and no one has cracked it yet (to unlock it).  AT&T would not have paid millions (hundreds of millions to be exact) had it not been able to guarantee exclusive use for years (and its a 3-4 year contract?). I mean, what's the point of AT&T paying them a big hefty fee if they are going to release an "unlocked" version anytime in the next 4 years?  O2 in the UK just did the same as well.  I'm sure one of the Japanese and the Chinese telcos will do the same once those versions are available.



So UK users will get it through O2 and no one else!  How sad.  Because its easy to fall in love with this.  So go buy one as an expensive iPod/Internet device.  That's about as good as it.  That would be same as buying an iPod + the Nokia N800 tablet I guess.  It is really nice.  I've had mine for a month now and I enjoy it.
what does it mean when headset support only in bluetooth?
this phone will rock if it had more features in the camera  but it doesn't and its probably going to have a bad battery life just like the lg prada and the nokia n95.Their all nice to look at but all suk when it comes to battery life. My opinion on the best phone ever is the w960 which is going to come out.Come on which phone has touch screen,8GB internal, 3.2 megapixel camera.what more does a phone need. Like for sure this phone would have a good battery life. That was never a problem with sony ericsson phones. All in all half the price of     the iphone,w960 is going to kill the iphone.
i like the web every thing else sux
Apple just has 1 phone and it has it's own section ? COmmon, this phone is BS.
Skypee? video ? Gimmicks?

contract terms to spend total about $2,000 u.s dollars to buy too expensive.
realy crap and over priced phone? they shifed hundreds of thousands of them the day of release... still i agree with the majority... its the most expesive phone ever! total wase of money... you can get the SE 960i for less than half the price maybe? or another decent phone, stick with nokia, SE! apple don't know what there doing!
So,

a revolution known to USA , but it is an archialogical excavation for the rest of the world.



all the features so hyped about like touch-flow can be installed on a K-JAM which is way ahead in expandability,and yet cheaper and UNLOCKED with changable battery.
becareful iphone , another one :



http://www.engadgetmobile.com/...-smart-f700/
surprise another touchscreen,now from samsung



http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/7463.html
No, you can't edit documents.

â does not support MMS and Internet calls  kypee.

â camera does not support video recording functions.

â does not support Bluetooth stereo A2DP.  â unable to watch the Flash website.

âonly support the battery 300 ~ 400 charge cycles.For these three things Iphone beats the rest:

1.The best ever body built in a phone.The

material used is fantastic.

2.The touch screen.Where are all the touch

screen pocket pcs? I bet none can hold a

candle to it.

3. The 'Itune'program.You do not need to

keep on visiting website after website

for downloads. You have everything

there.See!
COOL this is the coolest phone ever.

Apple Thinks Different!

Multimedia at its best on this phone!!!!

Like an ipod with phone
i think investing on an iPhone needs serious consideration. Not only due to its price but its limited and should i say frustatingly disappointing 'lacl of features' compared to other smart phones available.
to be a real multimedia smartphone, iphone must have 3 mp cam, 3g/HSDPA, and video recorder
Hi all.. was wondering.. so im maltese (europe).. and shall soon be visiting america, and was considering buying this glorified iphone... the thing is.. will it work when i go back to malta? -  as in would i be able to insert the local sim card that i currently use? Not sure about this AT&T contract thingy and i dont want to spend all that money.. and then not use it.. :(
Good Points: iPod and Apple are such iconic names that it will sell by the bucket load regardless if it is actually a good phone or not.



I think it was a good move to have it exclusively on only one network in the States, it gives Apple a chance to 'test' it's reaction, I'd expect they'll use the time between full release to tweak and fix any bugs, or develop softwear for it.



Bad Points: Would have sold better 18 months ago when all the technology in this handset was new.  By today's standard, what REALLY is that much different about this phone? (apart from it being from Apple?  Ooh, big deal!)



Also, are you going to want to replace your iPod every 12-18 months when you upgrade? I wouldn't want the hassel! With either 4gb or 8gb doesn't really make it a replacement for an ipod, yet it's bigger in dimensions than an iPod. Hmmm.
If your intention is to use you Iphone for internet, email and make phone calls....get iPhone it will make your life easier. Good job Apple. And for those people who gave negative opinion, Im very sure that you didn't even tested one.
hey guys do u guys kno how to use the mp3 as a ringtone....
thanks alkali.
i finally got it. eureka. the iphone is the most fashionable phone you can carry about. glitz & glamour. fame & fortune. hurrah.
Everyone should wait for apple to fix the problems that the i-Phone will end up having before u waste ure cash.. By the way touch pads are crap
H!!

Go to YOUTUBE website and check out compare with Nokia 95 and APPLE mobile. You will find disadvantages of this mobile.

by the way, those who so energetically criticize its built in memory - don't ever forget - no other mobile has such memory. And again, az I said, those who had never touched it, can only say it's not good. It has everything you need, and believe me 4 or 8 GB is pretty enough for anything...after all this is a mobile, not a desktop!!??! Not to mention the so called applications hat cannot be installed...?!?! this is ridiculous, the fashion handset has everything you need!
The best ever! I have it in my hands and I say it is something you'll ever want. You'll never need another mobile. Unless of course Apple release their iPhone Nano.

And...by the way Symbian sucks. My last NokiaE50 was a disaster, speakerphone went on whenever it decides and afterwards the mobile just block out. Bad.... unfortunately, because I am a fan of noki. I was in fact!
the apple phone.. hmm where to start.. its crap.. 4gb doesnt even hold all the stuff its supose too.. poor job id say. ipods only last for 500 charges-website says soo. its gonna get scratched alot. price is wayy too expensive. its a phone who cares what it has.. if u lose the phone ur screwed out of a phone and a ipod. u mite as well just get an ipod and a regular phone. this is ridiculous for how many people want this phone. its apple's first phone they r gonna have problems..
Very Good Comment lala I fully agree with you.



Thanks lala
good looking phone but i would never buy it... it looks fragile, you cant operate it from inside your pocket(or when you're blind),
all the people giving good feedback in here. I believe you are all american who have never been exposed by other high class brand handphone outside america lol. sad
Somewhere is a consumer looking at the Apple iPhone in an Apple or AT&T Store. They have always admired this phone and wished to get one. They like the beauty and simplicity; it does what they need. Upon announcing their intention to get it, they are advised by a friend, family member, colleague, or significant other, not to get it - as there are much better phones for the price. So, they are told about the 'Belchfire-2000' model with 64 terabytes of memory, the turbo charged WiFi, 200 giga-pixel camera, satellite receiver, DNA reader, and on-the-go breathalyzer.



While sitting in STARBUCKS, with the manual the size of War and Peace, they notice someone at an adjacent table sporting the iPhone. They look at their Belchfire-2000 in their hands and the voluminous tome of a manual and sigh; tears begin to well up in their eyes...



Get the point? If you like it, have always wanted it, get one! Don't get a phone someone else wants. It may do lots of things; but if the iPhone does what you want, then it's a good phone for you. And it is, in fact, pretty cool. And if you don't like it, you can always return it. Apple has a two week return policy. So, donï¿½t stress it.
Get real.Symbian is the best OS for mobile phones.All the rest are rubbishpJ0x: Feeling angry on yourself, because you couldn't get a simple app working on a simple Symbian... hah, well then iPhone is clearly solution for you, no buttons and no third party applications.



And i'm sure all Apple apps will have a big colorfull user guide for you to read and possibly understand, heck, you may even be able to comprehend sending and mms, o sorry you cannot on iphone do that :)



Cheers.
hi, I need your help.



why can't I use my wifi? I was trying to turn it on but they keep on asking a password? by the way, I use 2wire for the internet. where can I get the password? hope someone replies. thanks in advance-shippuden
Great design, (although copied from LG) the best user interface ever in a touch screen phone, and great music player. Thats about it. Its all in the marketing. Apple has way to many people thinking that this phone is so inovative. The only thing this phone has that is inovative is the ability to play You Tube on a slow network. Thats it people. If you want to make the ultimate I am cool statment then this is your phone. As for the rest of the world, we wont waste our money, and change service providers for a bunch of features that have been around for years.
Most symbian apps are pointless.Word/excel/powerpoint etc on the nseries is a standing joke.Then we have smartmovie and apps like that!Great if your unemployed and have 20/20 vision.I don't have the time to play about with silly nonsense applications so nokia n-series will never appeal to me.
I saw a lot of negative comments here, and I admit my first opinion of this device wasn't enthusiastic either.

There are just too many features it lacks compared to similar phones: GPS, Mp3 ringtones, a better cam and the like.



However, the phone seems to have a really nice concept and handling seems to be really cool - especially if one wants to replace an existing iPod it might be the right choice.



Anyway, this is the first version of iPhone - let's wait for a revision of it. I'm sure Apple is going to enhance the phone a lot. Just give them some time.
pJ0x: yet another narrow minded 60y grandpa. Yes keep talling that to yourself, instead of downloading an application for Symbian for $0, you will have pay money for application that should be free.



iPhone is just another money maker for Apple, they seam to have develop an unique business model - targeting not-so-bright people and luring them into belief that they are getting a better value, that costs a little more.



I havn't seen yet anoyne here admitting that iPhone makes a hole in your pocket, when it clearly does.



The same goes for Apple computers, for example forcing a user to pay for Quicktime in order to play movies in full screen - that is simply and clearly pathetic.



:) Enjoy.
So many negative comments from people that clearly have/will never use an I-phone.How strange!Anyway if the I-phones main qualities are playing music,video playing,web browser,and its unique touchscreen that seems quite good to me.Symbian phones are ok but who seriously needs 30 3rd party applications on a small phone?!!The nokia symbian fraternity have FAR to much  spare time on their hands.
Nokia N75 or E65..Because E65 small and has a tooooo many perfect features
iphone is alright... its not as good as the windows pocket pc's.. i tried the iphone for 3 days and i returned it cause its not good for business use. If your thinking about buying this iphone and replacing your existing pocket pc phone and blackberry.. i would say heck NO!! cause this phone stinks! i rather choose to buy the Nokia N75!!
to 2@1x,,,Ditto,,this is what i have been saying for years and have put many times on gsmarena why buy the i phone knowing upfront it does not have 3g or video record,go for a fone that does.People come on sites saying what it has not got therefore go and search for a fone that suits your requirements..I cannot comment on it yet im in uk but if they sort out these features for the european launch then they might have a big hit on their hands..From what ive seen in videos its quite a special device and aims at perhaps music, video playing web, browser,and its unique touchscreen which i see as divine is what its really showing off and it does it well..I look forward to its arrival inuk even if nobody else is ,,im using n95 now but change my phone far to often and this copuld be in the pipeline if the spec goes up
No Regular Blue-tooth, No MMS, Voice mail style will change, You cant change battery by your self, and cost about $80-$100, No Video Recording, and more No no no no's...And pay 599.99?..And if you return this phone, they will charge you Restocking fee 10%..
I can use GPS in this cell phone?

I live in Venezuela,  I Can buy for here?
to the guys who are complaining and posting negative comments,

first: its not costly when you factor in the cheaper monthly bill you need to pay for the 2yrs,

second: use it for at least a week or two before commenting about its features or UI,

third: buy a phone that fits your needs, if you need a phone that does GPS,3G,etc etc then buy a phone that does that and is more bulky and smaller screen than the iphone. also if u need a good browser & email solution choose between a blackberry with small keyboard and screens or an iphone.

lastly, most of the problems (3rd party apps, copy/paste,video recording,etc) are issues but they are easily fixable through a software update, so just wait till these are fixed in month or two before making a decision.



iphone has a market for itself, where people see the true cost of the phone+contract and want to get a better user experience from their phones. its not for everybody, but it is already changing what is being offered by the other phone companies, so we are all going to benefit from this. also dont forget, its much much easier to upgrade the software on the iphone, so maybe more people will like the phone when apple updates the OS on the phone.
amazing phone, great software inbuilt. screen is awesome, huge and very good quality. finger smudges cannot be seen at all when screen is on, very scratch resistant. touch sensitivity is also very good, but bare skin contact is not needed unless u r wearing thick gloves. decent camera quality, no video recording options. very good browser and ipod features, few crashes but none serious enough, the phone just drops back to the home screen and when the application is reloaded it just resumes from where we left off, eg the browser remembers all the tabs that were open (yes the browser has tabs!!). the iPhone unlike windows mobile phones does not need to be restarted when applications crash. I love mine, even though it has some very minor issues like no copy/paste or 3rd party apps, but the iphone is built to be upgraded very easily through itunes, which i can never say about the upgrade experience with other commonly used "smart phones".
Again and again..People who still want buy this phone, no problem, get it, but keep the box for Return before 14 days..This is My recommendation..
Save yourselves a favor, and please do not patronize this globalized, commerciliazed, ostracized piece of trash. I have owned numerous mobiles and mp3 players, and by far, this one I purchased a few weeks ago is rubbish to the ass. I have seriously not been as dissapointed my whole life as this. This product claims to be the bastard-son of the heir of the apple iPOD generation...but for God's sakes, what new function does this bring but deterioration. I'm sorry to say, but I would seriously rather get a phone/mp3 player from the following brands: Bird, Qtek, VK Mobile, Pantech, Haier, Genesis, BTX, Systemo, or even the fake yPOD phone made in the Chinese city of Guangzheng...
Can not load navigation software.

Can not connect GPS.

Can not load different ring tones.

Great Size and screen... but not really very usable with any other programs as all written for symbain or windows...

SPEED and unknown or big secrete?

Desent price but really aint getting much compared to dopod or atom o2 life...

Pity did expect more from Apple...

Hi Guys,



Is there anyone who has issue with the sound or the speakerhone?  I already maximize the volume setting to highest level but the sound is still low compare to other phone that I used. Thanks
mines broke the week i got it!

its super bad
Iphone is trying so hard to put so much into one handset which is great! user friendly and looks are fair. But the problem is, there are so many common phone features missing. With all the new cool design with that came out; GPS, full browser, nice video player, etc... but without the basics which makes the iphone somewhat like having new hummer truck that on 4 spare tires. Its too big as a ipod, too small to be UMPC and lost of basic features of a cell phone, what is it?It's true that you can in fact take out the SIM card, yet I don't really consider that a possibility. I've never heard of any respectable company telling you to grab something like a paper clip and jam it into their product in order to operate it in any way, in this case, remove the SIM card from a phone...That many consider as expensive. It's just foolish, and because you have to use something as unprofessional as a paperclip, that tells me that they truely do not want you taking it out.
I HAVE THE IPHONE, and I really don't like it. Here are some problems I found with it(By the way, I wrote the other review that's identical to this one):

-Minimal battery. Battery/SIM Card can not be taken out. If batter dies, you have to pay to replace it....No way around it.

-No Voice Dialing. No voice recording.

-No AIM or AOL.

-No memory card slot.

-No MMS service.

-On-screen keyboard...Hard to use for many.

-No A2DP BlueTooth...The good version.

-No GPS

-Smudges on screen

-Can not install new programs to the phone...MySpace IM, AIM, or LimeWire to say a few.

-No MP3 files as ringtones.

-Not so easy to set up.

-I find the back appearance ugly. Silver and black don't go well together on a phone, Apple. Why didn't you continue the chrome and black on the back?

-No Microsoft Office

-Dropping it = Death of the phone :)

-Not many plans

-$500-$600. I don't really mind because my daddy buys me everything I want, but other ppl have a problem with that.

-Random malfunctions. Glitches. It freezes sometimes. It should NEVER freeze.

-This isn't a big deal to many, but to me, it is. There is no copy and paste feature. It's great to use when you're quoting something that someone said. Or to send a large amount of text from a website to someone in a text message.

I believe that this is enough to justify my right to complain about the ever-popular iPhone. But, for what this lacks, I'll use my other phones to make up for.
YOU CAN TAKE OUT THE SIM. i have done it many times. there is a sim tray at the top of the phone. u need to use a paper clip to take it out. plus if u couldnt take it out this phone wouldnt be on gsm arena
* here are some reasons why you should buy this phone i did its way too good for me so im going back to my nokia



-Minimal battery life (just like the video i pod i brought few days ago)



-Battery SIM Card can not be  taken out



-you have to pay to replace the battery



-No Voice Dialing



-No voice recording



-No memory card slot



-No MMS service



-On screen keyboard a bit hard to use



-no A2DP blue tooth



-blue tooth available only for the head set



-No GPS (i don't mind anyway)



-Can not install many softwares to the phone



-apple got to be shame of there selfs to say this is a smart phone although we gotta pay the apple for every single application



-No MP3 files as ring tones , u cant set your ring tones as you want



-Not so easy to set up



-Random malfunctions



-freezes sometimes



-no copy and paste feature



-no 3g (i don't mind but some do)



-safari web browser without java support



yes you better buy it trust everyone whose telling you to forget about the bad side of this phone and go for it , trust everyone who had given the comments on web sites saying that this phone is the greatest of all ... you will love it after you use it for a week please do buy it i did i am sooooo glad , glad , glad more than enough yes thank you apple good product very nice of you
i love Iphone
The year is 2007, where is 3G and HSDPA support? This wont definitely sell in Europe and Asia-Pacific.
www.modmyiphone.com
i hope that apple should have taken another year to add the missing features to this phone ...



almost all the missing features in this phone are helpful stuff for the users of a smart phone i wonder what went wrong with em im upset to hear that this phone don't even have regular blue tooth options ...
IPHONE rules...no other phones can compare to the Iphone. I can only give 3 things: 1. Full website browsing 2. Physical appearance 3. Easy email setup. Good job Apple.
thats a apple? its ugly. no 3g. no HSCSD . no games. no VoIP. this is a 600$ phone? you kidding
Talk about a phone!!! the design is great BUT the performance and the features are not!!! to the makers(stick to the ipods and laptops)
Same here for a smart phone It should have better stuff its all about the touch and how it looks. I gotta admit its cool in some stuff but Worth 600$ and not the simple things like the camera 3g and that other stuff its a rip off cause thats what people want in a phone not just looks and stuff.
i put this phone on vibrate and well use youre imagination boys tricky sticky with the i phone and no i am not accident prone

every now and then i will give a little groan

its a good phone australia is the best place to use it as the net works are really good have fun
To Ksgp: I think you don't need a phone...BUY A DESKTOP instead!!!!!
FORGET ABOUT THE NEGATIVES REVIEWS they dont have the phone!!! I Have it!!!



I was SKEPTICAL and IM NOT APPLE FUN, i never been, but i got the phone and it is really nice phone, I have internet that works excellent, it works bluetooth, has voicemail, Youtube is so so quality with AT&T but Wifi is great quality, You can have Wifi anywhere, it automatically ask you if you want to check. You can check your emails...



AMERICANS have mouth to TALK and thats it...they complain for everything, that is why you see so many bad reviews here.



If you are a business people and need word, office or powerpoint dont buy the iphone.



If you are not picky, Just buy this Iphone, is the best phone on the market, IPHONE IS BETTER THAN N95!!!
lol i would like to point out that those that complain are ppl that dont know how to manipulate the iphone and add more applications to it or are just too lazy. Hahaaha yeah so stop complaining and start hacking
learn sumthin from nokia, SE, Samsung, etc.

only nice 4 its iPod n 16M touchscreen. other than that is Rotten Apple...
how lucky i am, i bought aa Ipod from Nicholas here in this comment and i got my Ipod 3days after it was ok thank you Nicholas

guys, it says comments about iphone not comments about each other.... i hardly found a comment about the phone itself, all what i came out with is that most of you dont have the phone and just dreaming to buy it, or ur browsing the internet for information about it and ur even not doing it right.



@ Mohsen, about the question that you ask Nicolas.. Well, theyre not fake, theyre not used either.. its just that they dont exist! It is a scam. You send him the money, you'll be screwed! If you get lucky, he'll send you and box with a piece of bread!Who do Apple think they are? Not allowing carriers to subsidize the iphone so we, the paying customer are forced to pay top dollar for a sub-standard handset that is not as good as the latest high-end offerings from it's rivals. Pricing the less affluent user out of the market is not only snobbery but foolish PR suicide.



Message to Steve Jobs, I can easily afford your phone, but you can stick your overpriced, over-hyped piece of junk where the sun doesn't shine. And I'll be selling my Ipod too. For snobbery like this you don't deserve another penny of my hard earned money. I only hope that others do the same becasue what you are doing is nothing short of discrimination.
apple of discord??? huh...
@Rhett Thanks alot for your review.

god speed you
Iphone is cheap! meaning... it has cheap materials, components are cheap from china, and cheap cuz its cheap! Iphone immitation even has better specs than this. 2mp? come on! My 6630 takes better pictures with its 1.3 mp and my 3.2 mp N73 is far superior than a lame 2mp iphone. N series rules! wake up tech-savvy wanna be! Webrowsing? it doesn't even have wifi in it. Screen? every dam gadget on this planet has the same screen resolution. Compare p990i with Iphone? i would rather grab p990i. For tech-dumies? Iphone suits you right and keep MAC dumb innovators laughing with their big bonuses.
Iphone has the best web browsing capabilities. Same thing as if your using a desktop or a laptop. Internet connection is pretty fast using the wifi and the edge connection is acceptable compare to other wireless provider. $600 is not really expensive compare to other smartphones. You have a phone, an ipod, a safari and a camera and not but the list an 8GB hard drive. So, do you think that the price of the Iphone is expensive?



no one can beat the iphone. the best in it's class.
I've got a Nokia 6110 for 6 weeks now!

it's a really good phone!

wish the cam could be 3.2mp but too bad!



planning to buy a Iphone soon

coz it's gonna come to Aus next year

can not wait for one more year!!!

apple u have done a big mistake by not putting all those needed functions to the i phone ...



---



i brought an i phone it sucks on its battery life and i have a apple video i pod its the same with its battery life its just a waste of money my transcend mp3 player does it better than the i pod ... and same with the i phone just like the pathetic i pod its a waste of money my nokia phones are far more better than that piece of (* beep *) even with the functions nokia phones can take out the i phone ... i recommend u to buy this phone if u wanna live another year or two swearing at the apple co. because of the less functions it have ... anyway i hope apple will release a better i phone soon ... at least i still love its design :-) and thats all i like about it ... so thank you apple for the nice design and i know u can do  better than this im waiting to hear the functions of the next i phone i hope it will be good enough for the cell phone world :-)
I've had my iPhone for over a month now and I must say that it has certainly lived up to my expectations.

I've had other phones and none of them made use this easy. I don't know how anyone could NOT like the iPhone unless they either hadn't used it, weren't smart enough to figure it out (which is pretty bad) or just enjoy hating great products.

Sure it has it's shortcomings. I wish it had 3G, but then again, I wish I had 3G in my area. So it doesn't really matter! The biggest missing feature is A2DP Bluetooth. I can't believe they wouldn't have made that standard on a MUSIC phone. If the iPhone is missing any feature that is worth mentioning, it's stereo bluetooth!

Typing takes some getting used to but I still like it better than the old style. Most of the time it figures out what I want within 2 or 3 letters so I don't type as much.

Sync is perfect! The screen is unbelievable! Speaker and speakerphone are...meh, It works in a pinch. I use my Jawbone headset 90% of the time. Storage is pretty good (I have the 8gig). I don't care if it has expandable storage or not, 8 gig is really the max anyone has available anyway, and if you need to carry more than that, you should have a laptop! If it had 100gig I'd fill that up too so it doesn't really matter. Grow up and finally learn how to clean your room like mommy said.

I did actually use MMS more than SMS so I was disappointed in that but I used it for Mo-blogging. Now, I just email the images to the blog instead and it actually saves my messaging limit (200 per month).

Camera...it's good in good light. I've seen better, but I've seen much worse. I think my previous phone had a little better camera.



Is it nice? Absolutely! Is it expensive? Not really! If you compare it to other nice phones. My last phone was a SonyEricsson w810i and it cost me over $400 and It's not even a third of what this phone is. Yes, I think it's a good value. EVERY PHONE has the same cost in terms of contractual or service rates so quite trying to complain about that one.



If you don't own an iPhone then you have NO right to complain about anything. Your opinion doesn't even matter. Until you have a chance to really spend some time using this phone under practical conditions, you can't comprehend it's real value. And no, I don't mean spending 30 minutes playing with it at the Apple Store while your mom is next door buying you underwear, I mean really using it, day in and day out for real life situations.

How came it will better if this phone have 80GB.
Interesting comments. But how many of you really use MMS, pay for that fun? I feel many folks are lost in details here.
it is a very good fone. i think that this fone is the best fone in the world.well done apple!
i like this phone nearly as much as i like myself... so that means not that much at all



James Robertson
interface? multimedia? sd card slot? ringtones?  ..   im a dweeb i love technology.. i speak english good
all i have to say is iphone is a piece of CR@p! all you "I-phoney" lovers...go see what a real smart phone can do(HTC/O2/ASUS/I-MATE/NOKIA N-SERIES AND E-SERIES).i live in USA and I do have the cingular service, but never ever going to buy the IPHON-EY, cuz its a wast of money. Currently i owen (NOK N75/ HTC P3300/ HP6915) , hehe..what can i say i'm a phone freak!!
To be honest I work for a mobile company & the amout of complaints about this phone would turn you away from getting it.

The only good thing this phone has to offer is an ipod but paying over the odds,

the other features arnt worth considering is was a tried & tested handset that will never do well,

you will eith love it or hate it as it isnt the best handset around there is alot better handsets out there with alot better value for your money!
600$ + 2 year contract = something like

2000$... okay.. even if ur using the service.. ur still stuck to a single phone for 2 yrs and whta the hell.. its like ur payin to become at&t and apple's Slave for 2 years.. ridiculous.. 2 years time.. nokia, SE and htc will be rolling out atleats 50 handsets which are 10 times better than this piece of crap.. its  agreat i pod.. buy the phone for the ipod features and use a nokia for everything else.. worlds most useless expensive phone

i think that this is the best fone in the world and everyone should buy it. i have got it and the camera is excellent. the touchscreen is great and the colours are gr8. i realy think that u should buy this fone. APPLE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!
WHAT!!! bluetooth for the headset only?! No video camera WHY!

Hopefully the delay in releasing this phone in the EU will mean a vast improvment on many of the features on this phone.

It seems that some of the really old handsets have better features than this.
I almost bought an Iphone last week. it was a sweet deal to sweet that made my throat ache. hehehehe... an sales agent was trying to sell it for me around $ 1000 and the sweet part of the deal was he only needs $110 for downpayment and the rest payable for 6 months. all he needs is ID and proof of my existence. I already knew what the phone was capable of after trying one unit from a friend of mine, and to tell you honestly the phone SUCKS big time! another profiteering sh@t by apple. It should be stripped off by its smartphone category and be brought down to as ordinary "Fashionista" phone. a phone for a tech-dumb... as for me Im sticking with my N-series the undisputed giant in the smartphone category.

www.mobile-review.com / articles / 2007 / iphone-sms-en.shtml



at the end of this excelent article the autor states:



P.S. If you can give us some constructive criticism on this article ï¿½ you are more than welcome, but please save us from the likes of ï¿½I donï¿½t use SMS, so nobody needs this feature for sureï¿½. Also, I canï¿½t take such arguments as ï¿½they will chunk this/that in some time in futureï¿½. This product is on sale today, at this very moment.

What's so special about this phone? maybe the(apple)the camera is only 2MP..feature wise? i think id settle for SE P990 or P1..
Bad Bob,



I agree with you that the Iphone is a substandard mobile device, and that there are many other phones out there that offer a much richer functionality; I just want to point out that the "Nokia N98" you are referring to is not a concept, but (if you look closely) a photoshopped 8600 Luna. I personally think the Iphone is a gorgeous mobile, but the functionality is just rediculous.
For those of you who are giving a negative opinion about the Iphone, do you own one or you're just reading some articles from the tabloid magazine. It seems to me that you don't know what you are talking about.
i like the iPhone. NO i will NEVER buy one because its features suck but it got other brands to improve their products. LG is producing KU990 and KS20. HTC made the Touch and Kaiser should release soon. And new concept phones have been created. some might be released. Sony Ericsson W999 for example and nokia n98 which is said to release May 2008. check it out:

http://www.mobinice.com/phones/Nokia/N98
A total ripp-off here.

It's oversized, the battery can't be removed without paying for it, no settings for the camera, no video..and if I'm not wrong, the design was stolen from LG (Prada, wich looks and performs better)

I wonder how Apple will compete with the Big Brand Names like SE, Nokia, SAMSUNG



This Phone is a major rip off!

In sms feature alone it sux!

It can send sms alright and thats it...

It cant send group message.. no delivery report.. cant save draft messages.. no message forwarding.. i think in review they did'nt told that.
okay first of all i didn't use this phone but i did read all the iphone users opinions... so i think it's not that expensive for 8GB memory and the neat touch screen but ...

there is alot of phones that have same price with more capabilities such as bluetooth

and MMS and GPS and video recording , sound recording and the most important thing the 3rd party applications, etc..

so it's a big mistake to have this phone when N95 is out there



(Apple try to concentrate in the ipod and leave the phone technology to where it belongs)



ipod, iphone i phone iphone......

i got tired hearing these rubbish sound, sorry job do some other job in sony...ha ha apple will never beats sony poineered in there walkman tech. apples strategy to being the leader in mobile world would be failed in somedays after the launch of iphone,

go for sony eric 8gb walkman phone with better (ear phones) sound software and camera

afterall its a sony by by apple....
hey rndz

let me somthin brother---apple is a company which failed in the pc business and the flop company in the whole world. there employer striving for thrier payments, steve jobs cuts no of job--ha ha thats why he doin thier own job(that the name suggest) now ipod is a mp3 player--basically a memmory based player and i tell u that walkman by sony is the best and always be the best, sony is the inventer of all technology, sony revolutionalize the portable music history by the launch of first walkman in the year1971, so dear where is steves apple in 70s i  think apple didnt grown on the tree ,

plz dont be stupid to by iphone or ipod they r just making peaple foolish

go for mp3 go to chinese made 20$ 2gb np3 i think it is better in sound and function then ipod ---- design of ipod i just like a tv remote whith a car yamaha bike wheel below

.ipod sucks and iphone to sucks
It sucks every way what a madness fore one phone. the only thing Apple dith was using old and available technology and turned it in one phone and saled it fore the highest price they could. it's not a wonder simply the phone cannot used on the technology much advanced GSM network in Europe and Japan.
I should have not listen to my friend to buy Nokia N95 instead of the Iphone. After two weeks, I decided to return the N95 and got the Iphone which I beleive  a very wise decision. I used the Iphone mostly in retrieving my email where ever I go. The google map helps my driving so much easier.  The phone is basic as long as you can hear each other. The camera is very descent nothing fancy, anyway Im not a photographer. The Ipod you cant complain and compare. Terrific phone.
7 wonders of the world? More like 7 blunders of the world. Like 4qMA quoted;



1. Camera has no auto focus or settings & no     video recording.



2. No custom ringtones allowed



3. Safari browser doesn't support Flash and Java

4. Really basic Bluetooth capabilities



5. No Office documents editor



6. No third party applications



7. No 3G support (at least the US version)



There you have it. The 7 blunders. A Nokia N95 is far more superior.....let me rephrase again. A Sony Ericsson P990i bug infested phone is whole lot better function than this blunder piece.
Quoting GSMA's own article:

"Camera has no auto focus or settings

No video recording

No custom ringtones allowed

Safari browser doesn't support Flash and Java

Really basic Bluetooth capabilities

No Office documents editor

No third party applications

No 3G support (at least the US version)"



So what most of you are saying is that you're so rich and stupid that you gladly shell $500 for a phone that can hardly do anything besides the advertized browser and music?
yeah i agree!!! it doesn't mean you have one that you have to brag about it. Its not even that significant of gadget
don't brag about having an Iphone for a mere $1000 or any pocket PC cuz you wont get my respect dude! you cant even afford a $40,000 car... duh! you save up you filthy *^&%... thats nothing compared to what I have.
If you can't afford an Iphone today, try to save your allowance every month hopefully by the end of the year you'll get it.





may be you can't afford it
all in one????

give me a break! iphone must have been a new phone for you from the ancient analog era. hahaha
this phone or whatever you call it sucks!ps - i'm selling mine, and going back to a vertu (there's NO substitution for it)
ok i gave in and bought one. although it seems like you guys have covered most of the ups/downs with the iphone. all i will say is that the multi-touch input is wonderful for 90% of usage, but lets down on certain things. if you are a texter (i send about 30-40/day), this is NOT the phone for you. no matter what anyone says, i use/switch phones constantly and i know the limitations of touch screen technology (at least at this point in time), and text input is 10-15 times slower for me on the iphone. i know its a revolution in some ways, but for the most part, the phone is just OK
awesome phone!
Other than it looks pretty i can't see anything good about this phone you might aswell get some tape and stick your ipod to your mobile proberly work better that way.
The phone design is pretty good prob. the best thing about the phone but features and usability could have been better. based on price and features the iphone is just a fashion phone and nothing more. Its not a smart phone,thats for sure and due to poor camera and media options its not reli that great of a multimedia device. Its just an expensive fashion statement. Maybe after apple does a iphone 2 i'll consider buying one until then i'm gonna stick with my n73 music edition :-)
Please check this website: www.popularmechanics.com

They have comparisons from different criteria.



the best
to Bad Bob



sorry but your facts are not right about the N98. This is only a concept drawn up in Photoshop. You can find the artist online who did it.



Could Nokia actually build this phone? I think they have proven they have the technology and knowhow to do so. But let's keep our posts and comparisons to what's real... not pie in the sky ideas.



Feature vs. Feature - yes the iPhone gets beat.



User Interface & Design - iPhone wins hands down.... for now.
It is a revolutionary phone in design, concept and usage..very futuristic. I have seen a demo and deeply impressed. I use a blackberry...but wouldn't mind having this toy!
iphone is a 1st product ur company but phone is good and feature is so good. But price is very high so please change the price. And one thing ur company PC is good.



Best of Luckkkkkkkkkkkk
Bad Bob,



Don't buy an iPhone and certainly don't buy three. I don't want this product to be for the masses. Just like Macintosh. It is not for all. It is for a dedicated group of people that wants to be different.



I see loads of new "unreleased" demo devices pass through my company from different manufacturers but nothing is like the iPhone. A new SEMC or Nokia device is fun for about 30 seconds. I am still thrilled after one month with my iPhone.



It is just that we are different personalities.



You - mainstream

Me - different



Don't buy the iPhone - stay with your SEMC device. It's your choice.
Don't waste your money, it does less than the average cell phone. Apple created hype and people fell for it.
look at this popularelect.com they got the unlocked iphone i was looking at there website for long time now they have it wow but the price kills me
Here's another website for your info:

If the phone has wifi, I don't think 3G or HSDPA is a big deal. I think Edge connection is good enough to retrieve you emails or use the google map to help you find the location. Use the wifi if you want to browse in the internet.  The Iphone make your life easier.

hmm, let's see... the touch-screen idea was amazing, but, no 3G, no HSDPA, no video-call, no expandable memory card, no organizer, bad messaging software, no sms delivery report, and many more cons.

well, i definitely not want it.

and i doubt that it would sell well here in my country, coz many people here love the 3G features very much.

IMO, apple should learn from other phone manufacturers, since they have more experiences for making good cellphones.

the best lookin fone ever.it has everything you cocld ever want and its well worth buying
Is there any GSM carrier in the US that provides a 3g connection and if there's one, how much? I'm just wondering why most of the critics wants a 3G when in fact an Edge connection will do the job for you to retrieve your basic email or to use a google map to find a location.way to go iphone noobs

apple released a better product, ipod touch, all the features of a so called pda phone except it can;t make calls.
Has anyone from Canada tried to use this phone with Rogers sim card?
once and for all would people stop posting about the iPhone not having 3G... there is no need for it in the US which is the only place the initial release was sold to.



that's like pointing out their is nowhere to drive my boat when I live in the desert!!
Can someone help me know if one can record videos in the iphone????????????
The 3G version will be available to Europe and Asia Market next year ..



It's not because of Apple not up - to - date .. for the 1st version of iphone , there's no 3G because of the service provider in US dont have this kind of facility.
Any smart device at present is not only about features - it is very much about the User Interface. A case in point is the Nintendo WII - it is outclassed by both the XBox 360 and the Sony Playstation 3 by a wide margin, but the better game play and the innovative control features have made it a hit while the powerhouse PS3 is struggling.



Even with phones - the UI does make a major difference and that is where Apple beats the competition hands down. AND I am not an iPhone user - I use a Nokia E90 Communicator.  Every little detail is looked into and things are so much easier to operate and run when its an Apple.



You just get used to User Interface that you take it for granted. Its is only when you use something else then you realise how difficult it is and how intuitive and easy it is with the Apple. So, be it computers, music players or phones - there are behemoths when it comes to specs and features, but Apple rules when it comes to the UI.



On a parting note - the specs in an Apple may not be the top of the line, but they are no pushovers either.
The killer app for me in getting the iPhone back in June was internet & touchscreen. The new iPhone Touch seems to cancel that out at a lower cost with no mandatory contracts. Now it seems pointless to get an iPhone (8GB) unless you want to pay extra for it being a phone (which it lacks basic features anyway), has only average reception, and having a lame 2MP camera where Nokia, Samsung, LG, & SE have completely outclass it.  Yes, even with the $200 price cut, it no longer seems worth it.
Taking the price down does increase the affordability to many people (like me). But somehow that decreases the cool "exclusive" appeal of the iPhone...What does others think? U gonna get one now?
Its not 3G tho, all those added benifts yet no G? WTF, noit geting it anymore based on that!

Move witht the times Apple!
iphone price just got dropped.. $399 8GB.
check this phone out brevisys deeda pi. it looks like the iphone but has no buttons in the front. it is thinner than the iphone with a slightly bigger screen and with the same features of the iphone + more

hey guys

iphone is revolution ...

do you know about cpu detail ?

*  ARM1176JZF chip with TrustZone (enables trusted computing environment for media, apps, network, OS, etc. -- very bad for hackers)

* Can vary in clock speed up to 700MHz or more, depending on implementation (thanks, Nigma)

* ARM Intelligent Energy Manager (claimed to reduce power consumption 25-50% in portables)

* 16K / 16K cache

* Features vector floating point coprocessor ("for embedded 3D-graphics")

* ARM Jazelle enabled for embedded Java execution (hmm...)

* SIMD, high perf integer CPU (8-stage pipeline, 675 Dhrystone, 2.1 MIPS)

* 0.45 mW/MHz power draw (with cache)

what is it for ?

thats for applications isn't it ?

this is apple product ...

wait for updates ...

just read
I believe that the Iphone's web browsing capabilities is very good and fast compare to other pda/smartphones when you are using the Wifi connection, but when you are using the edge connection I think it's an average speed.
Man I want one of these, but I got a Blackjack instead (for now) because it was 1/6 the price. For some reason I thought the iPhone had a 40 or 80GB hard drive in them though, and not 4 or 8GB of non-expandable RAM... must have misread at the store :) Well, I'd still like to get one, but I can't find much on the specs other than what I read here. So, if someone knows the answers to these questions, I would really appreciate knowing them... Does anyone know any hardware specs like the processor type/speed, or graphics capabilities (does it have a dedicated GPU of some kind)? Also, does the iPhone use standard 3.5mm headphones, or is it a proprietary 3.5mm jack? Anyone know about the iPhone's ability to record video (format, quality, FPS, resolution, audio)? How well does the iPhone play XviD and DiVX video? Can the iPhone function as a USB mass-storage device? Is there a way to run a video signal out to a monitor or TV? How about signal strength, and finally, durability? (anyone drop their iPhone and break it, or wear out the touch-screen yet?)
@ luigi: 1mln in 74 days...



Like i said there will be dozens of people that know better than Jobs that iPhone is a good mobile.



Jobs recently said, have look at my previous post link is there, that iPhone's weakest feature is a mobile phone. And yet luigi and others will always know better because they both this rubbish and now feel stupid.
"One million iPhones sold in 74 days."



And what's the total minus all the ones returned?
I like the UI of the iPhone, but I believe "Wifi" is hit or miss (& not always free) and Edge  isjust too slow to surf. Safari is the only thing I find practical about this device after the initial impressions wear off. The resell value is horrid after six months since Apple mass produces and updates constantly. I see no reason to buy the iPod Touch either since it really is an internet tablet that's been around for years now. I'm curious to see the Nokia N800 w/ Sprint next year. WiMax seems far more practical than Wifi for wirelss browsing mainly for its greater reach.
one million Iphones sold in 74 days
does the iphone have video call,so anybody can see me while calling them????
does the iphone work in South Africa
in indonesia they dont have at&t does it works with other gsm provider?

My iPhone has about 30 3rd party apps, making it more advanced than any other cell phones out there. iPhone is quite hackable and quite unique with the touch functions.
was wondering if the iphone would be able 2 work in the bahamas...45mins away from miami kinda hard not to think it wouldn't right
When you buy this phone on the apples's web site its unlocked? So can i use it anywhere in the world? or not. Help me please i want a buy one this week. Thanks in advance.

To all of those critical guys one millionth Iphone sold today !

In just 74 days, nobody ever even came close, and for a company that is a start up in the cellphone industry, stay tuned for more

humiliation of the Nokias,Sonyericsson,Sumsung and so on.

Steve Jobs a real genius helping mankind progress.
Finally even Jobs admited that iPhone's weakest feature is a phone itself.



IN YOUR FACE STUFTED-UP iPHONE USERS





http://crunchgear.com/2007/09/...try-already/


Ha :)
iPod Touch ( have the same features but not phone ) will be coming out very soon so if u do have a phone better features than iPhone for e.g N-Series or Sony but u like iPhone so i suggest u guys just buy the iPod Touch 8gb only US$299 W/O Contract..!! so what can go wrong with that..if u wanna have an UNLOCKED iphone which available now, seriously its not worth it cos it will hugely expensive like in my country cost US$1250 for 8gb...!!!! That a price of the cheapest Sony VAIO Laptop..My answer for me is my N73 ME with iPod Touch 8gb..better solution..think abt it guys...iPod Touch do have WiFi...
2007-09-09 20:13  mJCK can i use this device in romania?

....if you have the money...i think there will be a sim model too
what? $400 for iPhone! 8GB?! why is it $850 here in vancouver, canada?!
is this device usable in countries like egypt were technology is not so advancedTo: Mr. Job (Apple CEO).



The iPhone is for the USA market like Pontiac Trans AM, Ford Mustang and GM Corvette. Great cars for USA but not intelligent buy in the rest of te world unless you are an oil producer etc.



With the features of iPhone, it can NOT compete head on with the big boys like Nokia, Samsung and SE. THIS ISS A FACT FOR non-USA market. USA has Motorola as the big name and NOT like rest of the world where Motorola is not a key player.



You can release it in the rest of the world but with low profile campaigns and GET READY with an improved version of the iPhone to be launched in Europe/Asia so that can have 3G, MMS, Video, 5+MPixel camera, MMC card for data transfer, GPS, etc.



NOT A LOT OF EUROPEANS will leave their Nokia/SE/Samsung home and carry around their iPhone as their prime mobile handset. Few Europeans will buy it as an extra toy but this will jeopardize the GOOD reputation of Apple in Europe if you want to compete head on with the big names in the mobile business.



Take it from someone who has worked in all world continents, 30+ companies with one of the biggest USA multinational companies and with 12 years telecom experience.







i wont buy this phone coz its not a phone..



From the reviews I've read it takes 3 times longer than other phones just to dial a damn number.. This phone is for rich dumb people who just want to waste their time poking on a overrated endorsed device.



But of courwe this is a first Gen device so we can expect changes



I think removing buttons with tactile response is just a bad idea..







the guy who sed that nokia n95 8 gb is not 3g.are u on crack man?go read the review.it is 3g.
it is overrated i reckon.i was wating for it to come out and when it did and read the specs of the phone its quite limited in amny aspects. i mean common, they didnt inlcude 3g techonloogy in it.how dumb is that?a company so big ass apple i rekon should have done there research better.im from aus and cdma is phasing out over here.its all 3g.why make a phone without 3g.for all i knwo apples gonna loose al its business from around 21 million.it looks like a cool phone.best thing is the ipod thing.but without 3g.nnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaa.wont work out right
"My iPhone has about 30 3rd party apps, making it more advanced than any other cell phones out there."



LOL!!! My phone also has over 30 web pages bookmarked, but I don't call them "apps". We all know that web apps suck.



Tell me. Does your 3rd party apps include GPS navigation (like TomTom), or file manager or voice dialing, tethering, video call, video recording, A2DP, Copy paste, Java support, flash, etc... (list is endless)



BTW: I can use all the same web apps as iPhone can. But I don't, because they suck and I have much better native apps available.
because this phone is not 3G it will not be taken by all networks.  It will be available on O2 first.  Vodafone probably won't be getting it
Do the Blackberry phones connect to  I tunes music store ?
Does this phone accept blackberry connect?
Nokia N95 only 8 GB internal memory, no external card slot, no 3G, anybody of the anti apple guys complaining ?



Even if you will not buy it I am sure 10 million people will in the next twelve months, and my apple shares will keep on going up and up like they did in the past five years
This is an ipod not a mobile. lol
iphone new review from a know site:



http://www.mobile-review.com/a...one-en.shtml
Apple jumped in to quick trying to release a mobile but do not seem to think what people buy mobiles for i keep reading reviews about on www.mobile-review.com an nearly everything i have read about this mobile its got no chance being a success in europe,on the 15th theres a review about sms messaging an calling but i was so shocked how these functions are supposed to work on this mobile, so theres no chance i will every buy this mobile an want to hear peoples reaction when it becomes available in the U.k an Apple will then realise it was wrong mistake releasing a mobile before it functions were up to scratch
Of course you can go online with Tmobile once you unlock


http://www.apple.com/uk/ipodto...d=cdm-eu-141
sorry guys but look anyway!!
hi apple iphone fanatics i can now tell u the price of the phone its affordable (i hope)!!! check out this web site http:/www.apple.com/uk/ipodtouch/?cid=CDM-EU-141Â­9 hope this helps let me know what u think guys dj-bambixx
the iPhone is obviously the fastest selling mobile at this time since apple took $200 off the iPhone, both 4GB/8GB models. Remember this is apples first try at a Mobile device so I think we should be prepared for the next released iPhone which will possibly be around January/Febuary 2008. Im sure it will have the current features plus many more, I don't think some people realise apple could take lead in the mobile market by 2010. I beleve that Nokia, Sony Ericsson and Samsung will have to step up their game towards the near future and release something more interesting because there latest releases have not been that amazing. The week point of the iPhone would be the lack of 3G and external memory, but i believe 8GB is fine enough in a cell phone.
With I Phone Calendar you can

View your iCal, Microsoft Entourage, or Microsoft Outlook calendar synced from

your computer. Enter events on iPhone and they get synced back to your computer.

Set alerts to remind you of events, appointments, and deadlines.

Enough ?
Does this phone has the organiser capabilities? if it doesnt , can i install any other 3rd party softwares?
Autobots lets rock n roll use iphone its so cool.........Seriously Iphone is gonna change the way we think of mobile phone take for instance Samsung and HTC already imitate Iphone Multitouch to their new phone......... Iphone rocks...I hope soon will be sell in Asia's IndonesiaApple should not have entered the mobile phone arena...it's a pity...all that presales and advertising costs...they would have been better of giving all advertising costs to charity..poor poor Apple...stick to music devices and pcs okay!
is there any way to download messenger(Yahoo & MSN)Thanks.

This phone is a BOM.
Well here in the US, we don't actually care a lot about 3G.

There are many 3G phones, but nobody buys them.

People here need the phone for calls and E-mails, so what's the point to waste money on pricey 3G devices. To do what, watch TV and have video calls?

80% of the people here use Bluetooth headset and they keep their phones in the bags and pockets.

And iPhone is perfect.You just didn't try it. It's totally different experience from other phones. This is not just a phone.

I think you are just jealous because you have to wait a long time for it :)))))))

Its official!! The first U.K. network to get the iphone is o2. It will be released on the 9th November.
iphone copy lg
too bad i dont really like the look of IPHONE copy lg

hmmmmm, vert sceptical about ipod. cant believe that it has only 8GB and 2mpx camera. and where is 3G? does not americans know what we use here in europe?! and all that fuzz about it. no thanks, Apple, not now.
kathy i reccomend you heed the advise that has been given to you use this site to look up phones and specs to decide if a certain phone is for you.

i agree with tordrumguy read it post it i am guessing you were able to get on this site not becouse you have internet at home in fact you probably live in bangladesh or something like that but the fact bangladesh opened their first internet cafe whoooopie

the iphone is a great device revolusionary is a word that springs to mind how ever i guess if you are wanting one purely cause it is ipod with a phone and camera well see ya
hi.  just got my new iphone. its unlocked and working perfectly well here in hongkong.



but i have a question: does your youtube work?  mine does not even if im connected with a hotspot.



also, it does not work with my nokia bluetooh stero headset.



"Does The Media Love Apple Too Much?"



http://www.switched.com/2007/0...le-too-much/
This is Phone is really cool but where I live we will have to pay a wooping $7000.00 for it so there is no way I will every see myself spending that kind of money on a phone and half of the features aren't even available down here so that's my opinion but trust me there are alot of people down here who can and will buy it!
its extremely user friendly, nothing too complicated, but it has one major flaw.



use it for 5 minutes, and it becomes the smudgier and greasier than the roof of the fryer in macdonalds. And trust me, its not my hands, everyone i know has streaks along their iPhones.



Just, go get a decent sony erricson and save yourself ï¿½100.
I got this phone yesterday and is amazing & flawless.People who talked a bad thing abaut iphone maybe because they can't get it.(AT&T Only).Any phone can search any website,but they can't play youtube.But this phone is everything.Check Email,search web,youtube,music,video,etc.

GO APPLE

ATTN for iphone user,Does any one know any game,other aplication for it?.

Is there any way to make costume ring tone?

(i mean for free).

Thank you so much and i realy appreciated.
It will finally be coming to the UK, yeeeah! I read (

http://blog.gadgetlite.com/?p=213)
the Germans are getting their iphone with 16 GB + 3G, is that true?
This phone is good but i think apple should stay with iPods and not try and make phones because when your using it it seems like a ipod with a camera not a mobile phone!!!
do u have to use itunes to sync videos or music to the iphone?

if u do, must u pay/purchase those videos or music?
It launches on 9 November  2007

It will be available in O2, Carphone Warehouse and Apple stores as well as on o2.co.uk and apple.com.The 8GB iPhone will be available for ï¿½269 incl VAT on a consumer 18 month tariffs

Exclusive to O2 on consumer 18 month contract ï¿½ itï¿½s not yet available on business tariffs and contracts - of course business customers can still buy an iPhone but will need to take out one of the new 18 month iPhone contracts.

the real internet on your mobile with flat rate, all you can eat pricing, just like your home broadband. In a UK first, customers will have unlimited access to over 7,500 public Wi-Fi hotspots included in their monthly tariff
Yeah, I'm tired of hearing the world "Revolutionary" as a lame excuse to give the iPhone more value than it actually has, I mean, I don't see it doing anything new regarding communication, and by communication I mean making and receiving calls, and sending SMS, I don't mention MMS because it doesn't even have this function, but well, I don't know many people that use MMS a lot.



So please, iPhone defenders, enlight me about all this "Revolutionary" things the iPhone has.



P.D. Please, and I mean it seriously, don't try to sell me the idea of the multimedia functions, I do konw them, have seen them in action, and even though I think they are good, they seem far too simple, and don't tell me that the "Revolution" is making things simple, because that's just simply a lame excuse for not looking behind the fact that you don't want to feel scammed by Apple.



Thanks
This guy has Unlocked iPhones selling for $525. Seems like a good deal! Has anyone bought one from him yet?





http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISA...SE:IT&ih=014
Noooo htc touch is nothing like the iphone, the touch only works nicely on the menu screen afterwhich it reverts to some crappy screen. And its slow!Iphone unlocked is now only 525 compared to a 300 touch... i know which one i got, an unlocked t-mobile iphone!

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISA...SE:IT&ih=014@ musavir:



Yup i agree with u mate, one can never describe in words about this phone, Excellent phone by Apple!



Nokia, SE and Samsung should think over it!
Because there are a lot of skeptical guys against progress just like when they were against Galileo that discovered that the earth was round.

This device is a major step ahead in progress, it is not a cellphone like the others and should not even be compared to them.

You want a cellphone? get a Nokia or a SE or a Motorola.

You want to step into the future? get an Iphone !
how do you download applications for this phone?
Though it's resolution is good (480*320)

3,5 inch display

& sound in airphone may be uncomperable

But you see no video, less effctive camera, bluetooth and most importantly no third party software.

yeh, I think I never even think to buy it.

But surprisingly huge people disagree with me, WHY? What's the reason of it's huge sell?

Rumour, Status or simply curosity or anything else. I don't know. Do u know?
does it have have bluetooth and how to use in asia region. and also people say that if apple phone has to change some code if it use in asia region.
Anyone facing problems with the bluetooth?
its the best mobile ever made in the history of phones
now available in my contry ready.From Cambodia. But it is very expensive. 18 Sep 2007 it price is 790USD.

I think I cannot paid up to 790USD. Cos at Apple store only 399USD. Heey

Maybe no long it will lower pricing.
i have just bought it.. for PK Rs.45000.. its simply hillarious and addictive.. cant describe in words.. its colors are just amazing.. and yes its screen is scratch proof.. its sound quality in normal mode is not that much good.. but once you put its earphones in ur ears.. you feel like you are in a cinema..
does this work in Egypt?
base on the info given and reviews i read, i am so convinced in buying an iphone but what bothers me is if it would be possible to buy one without having to apply for a plan from   at&t and if there is a way we could use it with other sim card from other network in my country.. Im from the Philippines by the way..
Look at yourselves...

Why would you be asking for Java if you're already familiar with Mac Os X, why would you even buy a Mac phone if you're not a Mac person in the first place!

Those who think this is the coolest smart phone ever only because they saw the ads, please don't buy it! We don't need negative reviews around here..

Mac people, I believe this is the piece you've been waiting for.



It lacks some features, like the 3G and the Bluetooth thing, and of course the entire stressing process of unlocking and living in fear of being locked again with the next update, but, after all, it's worth every penny, it gives you exactly what you paid for.



PC People, if you're not really interested, go for hdc or iMate, don't bother yourself with an entirely new operating system!
i want to ask is it working with sim cards? or it's just made for AT&T networks
I asked a friend in the US that got one what he thought about it and if he could get one for me  as he is coming over to Switzerland next week and this is the reply I got :

Happy to be of service. The iPhone is already ordered. I'll bring it to Luca. It's the coolest phone EVER!



Rick

But over one million people think otherwise !
$400!! i don't think it worth that much. if it were up to me for design I'd say 2 for features I'd say 4.5 and for performance I'd say 1 coz my friend got 1 and he said it sucked out loud!
i like the phone very much. can i ask when will it be made available in the Philippines?

is there a possibility of 3G function?

The iphone is just a fancy toy. The call functions sux, the text functions are unworkable and the UI is absolutely uncustomisable. Anyone thinking differently are kidding themselves because they just paid a fortune for a phone that doesn't do much.
450 charges, approx 2 years?? Where'd u pull that from out of curiosity...
It works in Bulgaria Zambia and Burkina Faso get an unlocked oneThe market is where success and failure is measured
When they will release the last quarter sales results with a couple of million phones sold you will see where the shares end up.....
So tell me why the Apple shares keep on doubling every year and today they are at an all time high of $ 153.15.

This phone has taken off and is unstoppable

Market wrong and you are right dumb blond genius ?
To whomever replied to me regarding the dumb blonde comment of mine. Nokia and SE get paid EXPONENTIALLY more revenue than Apple ever will via this trully basic handset. It is a revolution in terms of the touch display; but only once this display gets utilised properly in a phone with decent features will this type of technology take off properly.
Yes it plays all the MP3 DRAM free like any Ipod
The phone can handle all of the items you say it doesn't have, just get the proper applications for them, now or later, it is a programmable computer with OSX  inside, just like when you get a new PC it may not have all of the software you need........



Hi. Would this phone play non-DRM MP3 files?
hi... this is the worse phone i ever had no mms no bluetooth transfer no video can't see sim directory i can give 100 out off 40 only for the looks and unique touch pad
This a F**** awesome Phone in the history, Nokia Samsung and Sony Ericsson are paaaaaaar away from it!! They even cant think like this!





Love you Apple(Iphone)!!!
OMG !



When this phone comes to Bulgaria i immediately will replace my Nokia N72 with this phone !



This is new generation !!!
Of course you can it is a Mac with OS X inside:

Skype Comes to iPhone

the iphone is set to be the biggst phone to bhit the uk market when is lunched with o2 the triaff maybe high but for what the phone can i think is it well worth the money.
can i use voip on this phone?
Here is one of  the many video software, you can even do video conferencing, try to do it with one of the plastic bricks

from the  other manufacturers, that once you buy you are stuck with what you get  caveman !



http://www.mobilewhack.com/iph...rencing-app/
Ahmad: I dont disagree with you this phone lacks in services BUT you have a choice.  Get a phone for looks or for function.  I am getthing this phone for its looks and not for function.  If I wanted a function phone, I would for sure go for SE or Nokia.  This phone has A LOT of 3rd party apps, just look it up. You can add NES Roms, flashlight, games and whole lot more. This is a completely programable phone and many functions can be added except 3G.  You also have to realize 3G isn't being used to its fullest over here in the States, 3G would have been important for Europeans and a good selling point.
i don't know why alot of people are soooo excited about this Iphone thing, come on for god sake Camera is only 2 megapixel and it has no auto focus or any settings, and U can't record a video!!!!dah! u cant even choose a ringtone, no 3G, No third party applications, browser doesn't support Flash and Java,bluetooth is very basic it doesnt support anything what kind of phone is this in 2007!!!! n95 8g with the new battery and 8g memory and even bigger screen will be the kind of all phones especially to this crap called Iphone, dont u guyz agree with me??



no mms, no regular blutooth, other kind of voice mail ( saks), battery life short and only they can change...lool...thats why price going down for 399.00
You are lucky that this is a programmable phone, future upgrades apps will address the issue
i just got my unlocked iphone. i live in the Phillipines & thought i was lucky to be one of the few to have an iphone. disadvantage of this phone is not having the choice to send multiple text msgs(here in the philippines, text messaging are often used than calling). you cannot also forward text msgs that were sent to, no mms/picture msg feature. you cannot also change the very soft sms tone,alarm,etc... I HOPE IPHONE would do something about these issues...
Ever heard of Google search ?March 18th 2008
can someone tell me when will iphone have UMTS?
Kate - There are some launch pages through Rogers that you do not get charged for. However, any other browsing you do you'll be charged for.



Canada sucks for data plans on all wireless vendors. They are expensive and don't provide much data transfer usage. This will be the barrier to the iPhone in Canada.



If you have access to WiFi at work, home etc. and can forgo the data cost that is good. If your company pays your wireless bill even better.



If you decide to buy the iPhone and use it in Canada, expect to pay a high phone bill if you do a fair bit of mobile browsing.
to n{0B



No, this stupid phone dose not have regular bluetooth..You cant send and receive any files by bluetooth..Only it works for headset..baaaaaaaaad
go to an Apple store
Does anybody know where I can see some pictures taken with the Iphone's camera?



I would like to see how good the camera is first.



What about this touchscreen. Wouldn't it mark or get the screen dirty? Have never had anything touchscreen before.



Other than that looks amazing!

Tons of applications for your Iphne :



http://www.everythingiphone.co...n-directory/

i live in canada and use rogers, and someone told me that everytime u connect to the internet they charge u...can anyone confirm/deny this?
I heard, Apple making new Iponhe, and they adding allot of features as Regular Bluetooth, You can send and receive Picture ( MMS ), Video recording and more perfect things..If you guys member, 2 months ago this phone was 599.99 and after2 months now 399.99..why ???

my email vaibhavverma@dce.ac.in
Isn't this phone too much over rated?

HTC TyTN II is a much better device.
Good phone, just that.

Such a pity you cant RECORD videos.

Such a pity dont have GPS.Iphone is a great phone but Steve Jobs is a TOTAL INCOMPETENT not to allow

3rd party applications with the new firmware 1.1.2
iphone sucks you cant used it to other country what kind a cellphone is that damm it!
i like how the phone looks like but i hope you can improve this to vie its features with nokia e61i.
As a full blown OSX Mac computer is quite lightweight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 3G....only 2megapixel cam...no games. no infrared.DAMN HEAVY!!!! apple disappointed me.i like their ipod though.
Why did you buy the Iphone if you don't know the features?
THIs PHONE sucks,i bought it 3 days ago and im selling tomorrow.

pros...the screen size and colors and user friendly.

cons....No AD2P

Heavy= you can't take it to the gym because your pants will fall down 'cause the weight.

Camera sucks.

is always dirty with fingerprints.

You can't use any ipod acessories like speakers.

and many more...





Dear Mr Cohen,

I live in Hungary.

Can I use iPhone here?



Many thanks,

Miki
i use an 8gb iphone. I face a lot of hangups. Then i need to wait till the battery goes off. Does anyone experience the same? plz reply me. I think HTC Touch will be better. What do you think? But afraid of the sound quality :S plz reply guys. thanks!! :)

If the Nokia E90 is such a better phone than Iphone how come that they do not convince telecom companies to pay them revenue sharing on the traffic of this * advanced and complex device "

Why to miss this opportunity ! Apple does it !

Is this the reason why Apple shares outperform Nokia 6 to 1 in the past four years ?

Bad management Nokia !
Better than which model Apple computer ?

I would like to know !
can u tell me all,wat if the i phone hangs,cant remove the battery,theres no reset button,wats the solution then????
Even though the iPhone is a great phone, the Nokia E90 is way better than it. The features the E90 hold are way more complex and advanced than the iPhone. Nokia has created a phone that's better than some of the Apple PCs!!

it is possible download Flash Player for iphone ?
i Dont think that Apple phone is anything special,i would rather buy a SE phone
Unfortunatley no. But the specs of this phone speaks for itself. For a first launch phone in such a vicious market today, Apple have simply let them slide. Perhaps I could apply at Nokia. I'd love the n95.
Gareth - you have to be the only person who disputes the facts pointed out by every financial newspaper and magazine out there who talks about how Apple has secured a higher percentage of call and data revenue from wireless carriers.



Let's test your math. Other phone vendors get 0% of the call and data revenue. Let's say other vendors sell 40 models of phones and each one brings in $100 in revenue (40*100 =  4,000*0% = 0). Apple gets 10% and sells 1 phone that gets $100 in revenue (1*100 = 100*10% = 10). Any way you slice it 0% of a billion dollars is still O% nothing, nadda, zilch.



Do the other vendors make more money selling phones than Apple, sure they do. They sell multiple time more phone units. But they do not get a higher percentage of carriers revenue. That is a fact.
I would kindly refer everyone who loves this phone to this web page. And thats as simple as it gets.
Only phone with a full blown computer operating system, the best operating system by the way OSXis it possible to transfer music by using bluetooth...plz help !!
yea i phone is perfect and now i have it..But before i had Nokia N95 and it was perfect too with GPS..Only think i would say the bad section to iphone, apple didn't add allot of programs and features, so that features im sure each person need every time, and i hope they will update some day..Let say, you cant Forward the SMS, or, you sending SMS to some one, you cant add some quick notes, or you cant copy and past other place's..No MMS too...But, still i like this phone..
I think Iphone is still the best phone in the market as of now. If you travel a lot, I think Iphone will definitely help you with the following features.

1. Safari full web browser - very similar to    a desktop computer.

2. Google Map - you don't need any other website to find a location.

3. E-mail - you can retrieve your email anytime, anywhere.

The phone and camera is acceptable.







I had the HTC touch and returned it. It did not impress me and texting was a nightmare. Now i have apple iphone and this is so much better. Very easy to use!
hey i am getting it tomorrow and i am very excited. you can ask me whatever you want after i post a short review.
macs designs are great so is iphone
no way men

htc is ugly

i prefer iphone then
i buy it from india unlock one its has of biggest problem of hangging . i lost my money

rakesh

guys the phone is between my hands

what do i do ?

buy or no

i m confused

Yes I tried the HTC touch at the  Comdex electronics expo in Singapore, even the HTC salesperson had a hard time to get the touch functions to work properly,

piece of crap without the Apple software inside
Guys have you tried the HTC - Touch , who ever bought the iphone will regret for sure :).

im thinking of buyin the new i phone what is peoples opinions of this phone. is it worth it
Don't listen to the rubbish about a virus etc. Apple have put out a update 1.1.1. Do not update because it will lock again. Everything still works fine if you do not update. Best phone/ipod ever!
Got a unlocked iphone 2 days ago. This phone is amazing! Very easy to use. Everything about it is great. This phone should be rated 10 10 10. Beats ANY phone on the market today. Nothing else even comes close and my last phone was a n95. Best money i have ever spent on a phone and its worth every penny!
399$ 8gb model

299$ 4gb model
The iPhone is the recent greatest Apple creation. It is NOT a phone to compete Nokia N95. This is a GADJET that can ONLY be appreciate by the Apple/ipod lovers/users.

If you are an ipod user this mobile gadjet definitely is fot you.



It works perfectly if unlock in Greece or anywhere in the world.



Prices are NOT $399. You can NOT get this phone for $399 unless you are living in USA and will sign a contract with AT&T minimum $60 x24 months=$1440 + $399 = $1839.



If you do not want it unlock then you can still sit and read THEORIES and read others opinion but you won't be able to enjoy this Apple gadjet.



By the way, you can use all your Apple ipod Accessories with the iPhone. I used to have a 30GB ipod and now I just got the 160GB Classic to complete my collection with the iPhone. Now I have all the space to save my Music, Videos, photoes and make phonecalls.



I am wondering how was going to have been this world without APPLE products? Very poor indeed.
We suggest noone buy this phone. It is a sucky phone. We bought this phone for $2,000 unlocked at the first day. The day i got it it got locked due to apple sending a virus. They try there best to destroy our phone
awesum phone man wi fi 8gb memory man lcd koooooool
Your friend phone maybe need's to repair, because i have same phone and im texting each day 1000 text but my battery still perfect..
yaaaawn,my friend had an unlocked phone,sold it after 3 weeks,impractical if you are a heavy sms texter,poor battery life,so so mp3 sound.I got an iPhone fron US & had a techie unlock it for me. It works great on O2 network.

If you upgrade a locked iPhone, I believe that it will recognise that the phone has been hacked/unlocked & will then disable the phone. Tip: just don't accept the upgrades!



A few minor issues with the IPhone; you can't forward texts (no sharing of those jokes. No 'copy & paste' anywhere. No video, No multimedia message by SMS text, Bluetooth only works with a headpiece/visor kit but cannot shart date/pics by Bluetooth.

Yahoo emails works great on it; more cost effective that a Blackberry email contract.

Hope this is useful

hey...can someone tell me please...if u have an unlocked iphone...can u still update your iphone?
the speakers on the bottom are pretty bad for playing songs. other than that, the iphone is very good to use. :D
Unfortunately i lost my money. Its only a beautyful toy.
How can you say you can ignore 3g? and it doesn't have bluetooth either,i guess it's so stupid to make such a phone and leave bluetooth out
Dont surprise i am typeing this on my iphone at 30 cps. This typing is like type writer . Very simple and easy opration.file trasfer via blue tooth is not allowed may be some reason. Hacking ristricted . Nokia guys i just wanna tell u just try this phone for once i sure u will forget nokias all work .

I need the second song from this prezentation video of the I-phone(i feel the ... in the air) PLEASE HELP ! I`m DESPRED
Had the Iphone unlocked for about one week here in Switzerland,

I am coming from Nokia E 61, there is only one way to describe the good Nokia E61 : OBSOLETE !

The more I use the Iphone and the more I can't do without,

3G ? I had it on Nokia, but I frankly do not care not having it on the Iphone it connects smoothly on Wi FI at home and at the office.

The softwar eon the Iphone is simply another planet and when I look at the E61 it looks like a stone age tool .........

you have to have it to understand it ,

anybody making negative comments simply does not have it

United Kingdom... not sure when they'll be out where you are i'm afraid. Ours are ï¿½269 (gbp) to buy on a ï¿½35pm contract (inc un-ltd data usage). They're O2 only and are sealed units so not really worth trying to use other networks here and if you try to reprogram the software it messes up all the cool functions anyway, but the look like a totally awesome bit of kit, there asre some really good adverts for them on u-tube! :)
Carphone Warehouse launch these 9th November, can't wait!!

Check out the website... www.carphonewarehouse.co.uk
this phone sucks i bought one about a mounth ago and its already busted, the reception is horrible, and the screen is too small. its a waist of money, if i were you i wouldnt buy it.
For the bluetooth, "headset support only", that means that I cant send things like songs and pics to other ppl (or receive?).
This phone is for ipod lovers. No compatibility with Microsoft outlook. Useless for me. I would rather prefer HTC touch.
real gud gadget...it rocks
jeany!



watz up? here in bahrain its already out in the market but unlock version not from apple. BD 360 around $US952.



they say its good, but the problem is you can't upgrade it coz it will burn the mother board.



to all iphone expert out there can we upgrade unlock version with out any risk of burning the mother board.



to all i phone user will u pls tell me if it is worth buying?
Hey guys, heard that iphone is launching iphone 16g with 3G!!  I wonder when it's gona be available.  I missed my iphone as i sent it to unlock.. Great phone ever!! Can't wait for the next version.
I like this phone because it does not appeal to stupid PC people
If PAC-MAN is the only thing going for this phone itï¿½s a waste of money. Plus not having Bluetooth is a very big mistake.
Hi can anyone tell me if you can download your own music such mp3 from computer to i phone?
no video or  bluetooth? big disappointment!Can someone please tell me whether simply using itunes 7.4 with my unlocked iPhone will automatically lock it? Thanks in advance.
For all of you that dont know I work in a call centre on behalf of o2, the only mobile phone service provider in the uk to provide the all new well awaited apple I-phone.



I'm in the process of buying a macbook Pro, so was very interested in the new i-phone as everyone as been going crazy over it. As far as we know it is due out on the 091107 I'm expecting this to be put back or it will come in and go straight out I know o2 too well lol.



But I decided to do some investigateing to see what deals we could get, and on a tariff ï¿½35+ you would have to pay ï¿½269 which is alot of money and I am shocked at this so I thought seen as phones at this price are normally good phones I would have a look.



Now I dont want you to take my word for it as people dont believe that Apple could bring out such a rubbish phone so heres the link to a website we use and straight to the i-phone for you to check it out



www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone-1827.php



Take a look at the bluetooth connectivity and note it is only able to connect to a bluetooth h/set and not another bluetooth device???????In this day and age and if you check the rest out man its crazy, so I read the reports and found everyone was in love with it and wondered why when it hasnt come out, Heres the reason...............

It has already been brought out in the USA and because the USA arent as Advanced as us i.e. they are only just getting bluetooth, they dont have stuff like GPRS + MMS like we do etc... etc... basiclly if we went and looked at a phone in the US we would be disgusted at what it offers because the are so far behind us.

So this explains They are going crazy over the I-phone cos to them its a great spec but from over here, If I was you, and what I will be doing is saving my money, the only good thing is its an apple products but I am shocked at why it is so low spec for the price.

the stemeister

Today alone I am making 300 K on AAPL ( Apple ) shares, not to mention the millions I have made in the past months and years.

I suggest you take a look at the results on the Stock market for Apple, the MARKET is ALWAYS right in judging SUCCESS

other opinions are PURE GARBAGE
I would say iphone is perfect again and again..But Here in USA the EDGE working very bad with Iphone..It is very very slow..Thanks god iphone has a wi-fi, so we can go online with wi-fi..But other model phones working perfect with EDGE...Apple must fix this problem also, and couple of things too..
Again apple have shown that the product is not as important as the hype that surrounds . Taking a flawed and unimpressive products and making people with low IQ's and even lower standards believe this is a must have item .
this phone is rocking, have some function missing but ok this is esayest touch phone very simple to downloding contact game and application i downloding lot of game in my iphone its rocking
Peter,

The bluetooth only detects Head sets or Car sets.
If you'll see the fone, u will think its great but when u use it,u will curse it!ï¿½

Im most in favor w/ Nokia NSeries and Samsung Ultra Editions

=)
Great phone but missing couple of elementary features..Calculator missing %, missing copy/past option, and couple of things, but still perfect phone and # 1 in 2007...Dont seat there ans talk empty.... PEOPLE ?
Hey guys I was just wondering and I cant verify it in person, but is it true that you cant use a different type of headphones E.G. sony headphones to listen to music from the iphone?
i want to know if the iphone is bad mobile or not and isome people say that it sound is very bad and low ,and it is very slow in loding is this right or not
to arkied-philippines



hows the ipod? is it working well? can you customize ringtone also?



thanks
had my iphone for two weeks fell in love the first i saw it, works pretty well sync perfectly with my itunes even though its an unlock phone, i just made sure that i dont upgrade it :). crisp, clear display, though alerts is a bit soft but i keep in vibra mode generally its a great classy phone in terms of design and performance, Apple you are great! thanks
to MGR,



i think u dont know how to use the iphone? thats why u said its a waste. my friend try to maximize the phone first before u make complain. oki
To MGR

you are right it is a total waste to buy a Nokia I also had an Iphone for a couple of weeks and I feel my old Nokia E61 is a total waste

Apple making the future, could not live without my Iphone now

the software is simply not comparable  with old phones.
Hi Folks,

Here the story that I have to tell.



I bought an unlocked Iphone 2 weeks ago, and all I have to say is :



*Screen resolution 10/10

*WIFI 10/10

*Phone reception (Edge/GSM Networks.. No 3G yet in Canada, therfore the Iphone works perfect without 3G )9/10

* Bluetooth 6/10 ( Pairing only works great on my Acura, no data Xsfers though)

* Safari / Web browsing: simply majesterial, feels like surfing on a mini laptop 10+1/10

*Camera, 4/10 , Frankly, I find it personnaly useless, no auto focus no editing mode...etc (When I'm serious about photography, I'd grab my D80 DSLR and go shooting)

* Finally, Cost/Benefit ratio: I'd rate it @ 9/10 (wethear you r an Apple freack,or coming from different cell phone platforms, Once you'll test the device, you will quickly notice that the Iphone sees the world in a different dimension in comparison to any other high end phone out there Today!)



Bravo Apple, You just broke new grouds, the future is bright!!

In my opinion, this is the best phone ever made YTD.I'm delighted to own the Best Gadget of the Year!



Cheers to All Iphone Owners
Hello all, This is Rohit from Chandigarh(India).I want some reviews regarding this phone, as I am interested to buy this phone, but need some info regarding the useage, I heard that this phone have the hanging problem, and off-course the actual shop price.
it's totaly Waste...i Used for 2 weeks.The performance is not equal to Nokia Phones.So.... all buyers think to buy
hello Iphone people



can please tell me how to create iphone ringtone? coz if i doing that in i tunes it says that i can only create ringtone if i buy it in itunes but the problem is middle east is still not in the list of country where we can buy itunes musics.



and is there any chance to uodate the software if u are using unlocked version of iphone?
i also cant understand why it have dictnary on qwerty keyboardIts obvious that when apple researched the phone they simply didn't put enough research into it, no forwarding of text messages, can't save the number direct off text messages, i mean please for a company as big as apple not to do major research, i mean all they had to do was pick up a nokia and say oh we'll shot all this in and more. This phone should be sold as a cheap kids i-pod mobile in one.
Former Vice President and Apple Board member, Al Gore, won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Apple.com's homepage updated with a tribute to Al Gore:

www.apple.com

We are waiting for a Nokia guy to win the Nobel prize....
So when is Nokia going to get millions in revenue sharing from the phone companies like Apple does with the Iphone ?

NEVER in this world with those plastic obsolete N95!



i just sold my iPhone today the phone sucks, texting is hard.. i trade it for n95.
njnc. i saw iphone last night. i asked the guy to play a song. there's no volume to it man. he even showed me the speaker to it, 1 tiny little speaker at the bottom. wake up and smell the coffee and sell that iphone while you can still get 50 dollar's for it.
Today i receive one SMS with a phone number i was needing. all new phones have the utility when reading the SMS to save the number  or use it (copy or save). But Iphone is much better, it come with a papper and pencil. So each time you recive an SMS with a phone number you use pencil and paper and write number after u use iPhone to store. Apple make grate Job  I Hate iPhone
Hello guys,just wanna let u know that i posting this post using my iphone.as far as i use this phone(comepare to what i had last two month which is the n95)let me tell you this-the n95 can't compare to iphone at all.because the price and the feature are huge different.also,i been using the iphone for one month now and doesn't have any problem.for those of u don't know about iphone let me update it for you guy.the iphone can be unlock to use with any carries and 3rd apps is possible,tv out,google map,play nes game,run cmd or control pc using wifi(so if you got wifi you can control your pc at home),anothee fearture is youtube(n95 can't beat iphone on this...because n95 use mobile utube and iphone use the actual utube).now,it come in to the point where i can say the iphone beat the n95 because it never run out of memory when running software and web browsing(try open ebay in n95 then you will know what the heck im talking about).       Good luck buying phone guyz.yeah i love my shine iphone
last night my son went out to dinner with three college friends, he has an unlocked I phone here in Switzerland, as a result next week when I go the US for a business trip I have to buy three I phones for his friends.....
If the N95 is better than the Iphone how come that the phone companies do not pay revenue sharing for the traffic, how come two million people bought it in 100 days, how come the apple shares keep on going up and up, come on try to understand that Apple is making history with this device and put your envy aside.
You know ? Iphone is Mini computer, if it missing some programs, you can update or upgrade any time later..Only phone we have now, we can use as same home COMPUTER ... see? before calculator was bad, but today apple update new style Calculator and it has a % and more..Be patient and you will love this phone..But i love it from 1st day..
Before i had three N95, with cheap plastic keypad, and loose slider..So what, if it has GPS? Ipone is the best..
can i ask if there's no problem regarding chatting here on iphone? because my main purpose to buy this phone is for chat. pls reply your comment here or on my e-mail add at allanhuntington@yahoo.com.. thnks a lot

I have one and is true you canot forward SMS and this is really big problem. Imagine you have one address and you are in one country with wired characters: Greece, China, Japan etc... So you must sent  the address where you are to you're family or friends. What you do if you have it on you're phone? Ask someone with normal phone sent it because you have Apple iPhone.  I am thinking to sale mine even if i have it for 2 days now.

* From the hearing point of view W-series from S-Ericsson have nothing to envies iPod or iPhone. Also  the headphones are very bad..take a look to the  Apple. com section iPhone then Headphones. Look how many complains.

* You have Wifi but canot make VOIP calls this is realy stupid

* You cannot modify Excel , Word   documents but in SE P series you can from 4 year ago. Also a lot of third party application can do this for UIQ based phones

* you have 7GB free space but you cannot connect to computer save sensitive data to the phone

* iTunes and Vista just problems



I hope I can resale it even if I lose a little money but at least i am not worry anymore about all this problems. Maybe future  version of iPhone is gonna be better. This one is just some kind of Joke or Demo as for sure is not a serious release.
Great phone, and already apple has a allot of application do download from apple..You buying one time, and dont think allot..This is Mini computer and phone..
i think there is too much discussion about this fone. i though it was a gud idea...apple releasing a fone but it seems to be a marmite thing - u eaither love it or u hate it. my mates got 1 n he's works fine but personally i think i would wait until apple release an updated model or even the nest one up before spending that kind of money on a fone.



and to those that jus keep criticising the fone about petty things..........BE HAPPY WITH WHAT U GOT N DNT TRY N PUT OFF OTHERS IF U CANT HAVE IT!! at the end of the day its only a fone n not gonna do eveythin perfectly is it.
It's just a pretty phone. After reading these posts it appears the majority of people really only use their phones for calling and texting. They want these 2 basic functions in a pretty shell. IPhone offers this. There's no arguing it's terrible in all other respects but if you just want these 2 basic functions and went them done well, buy the IPhone.
is the iphone good?? please someone tell me. because i want 2 buy one.
is the iphone good cause some people are telling me it is not good???? i think it is good but if there is tv and microsoft word it will be much better. if there is a phone with wireless, tv and microsoft word please email me and tell me if there is one.



my email is,

I think the contract prices from O2 are compeletly unreasonable. For ï¿½35/month you get 200 minutes and 200 texts?!



I got my N95 on a ï¿½35/month contract and i get 600 minutes and unlimited texts!



also the iphone looks great and im sure is alot of fun, but...



The "great" web browser has NO flash and No javascript!!!



The camera has no settings and no video recording



It cant multitask



The bluetooth is incapable of transferring files



its 145 grams for a featureless phone...



get an N95
Here is the link from apple.com, now you can take allot of programs and save in your iphone, and new calculator too..





http://www.apple.com/webapps/I change and buy phones evry couple of weeks. Iphone can now be bought anywhere unlocked for $599. I dont know why people wait till it comes out on orange or o2. the phone is fantastic as a fun phone accessing youtube,listening to itunes music etc. it is a breed apart from any phone in the market when looking at pictures even the typing takes time but becomes super easy. Unfortunately without push mail and 3g it cannot be taken seriously by someone like myself who needs immediate access to my work email and miss sending emails or texts via Qwerty keyboard. i recoomend the iphone for use at the weekend and switch to a more serious phone during the week. I hope the next iphone will prove to be one for everyone to use as the technology used is superb.
This phone is a waste of time, I would rather buy a 160 gb ipod & a cheap phone for the same price, atleast I know i'd be gettin alot more for my value, damn apple, I AM DISAPPOINTED, I shall keep to Sony Ericsson & Nokia, atleast I know i'm gettin something of value.
Dude no matter whr u live this software works everywhr ..The name is Ibrickr





http://cre.ations.net/creation/ibrickr


U will find everything here..

Enjoy n have a nice day
thanks for ur help vassim and kyo.. but i want to ask u.. were did u get the software for free ringtones?? the problem is that i dont live in the us and i cant buy from i tunes :S help me please
This phone is not heavy at all.



For the weight of 135g, you get Ipod, Phone, Internet Browser, Video Player, Third Party GPS, Goggle Earth and a PDA all in one.



Also, the unit is quite thin as well, so it fits into pockets nicely. Personally, I reckon thikness plays a much more important role than weight when it comes down to whether it feels comfortable with the unit sitting in your pocket.
hey guyz could any1 tell me where i can get the software (for iphone)to forward sms and sending sms to many. As its very hard for me with out these 2 features.
And for ppl who say that the iphone is ok and bla bla bla ...I think either they have no knwledge abt phone or they have not used the iphone .....use it to belive it .......
As for ringtone and other applications they are all available for free...i have installed the ringtones and some applications and they just work fine no hassels at all simply fantabulous...as for bluetooth is only for headset never mind stillit is the best
apple iphone is the best phone ever made by apple...till now no phone is even close to the iphone...the software the looks the navigation the features are simply awesome.

thr is no comparision as of now..keep it up apple you are the best..nokia is far off to catch up.....and other's are no whr in the scene....simply brilliant !!!!!!!!!!!!
The Apple iphone is ok if you want a mobile phone for the metro areas outside those areas its uselessand the battery is not removable once the battery is dead you need to replace the phone completely.The nokia n95 is a good phone for its camera and the gps but you need to get a data pack to download the maps and for the battery its useless lasts 1 to 1/2 a day depending on your usage. if you want a great phone get a HTC 3600i / dopod a completely awesome phone with mobile windows 6 version and no real issues with the Battery or the software completely touch screen and very sleek and sylish.
WOW! I mean WOW! The quality of this phone is excellent! Simply superb! It does not have as much features as my N95, but the build quality is top-notch. I love it sooooo much! Thanks Apple. I'll be waiting for your other phone releases.
I'am reading what people are saying that no good bluetooth application's, can't apply song's as ringtone's. i also know no video recording. no voice dialing. people should tell apple to go and take a hike.
Iphone bluetooth can only be used with headset. As for ringtone, you can't use your own songs. Apple doesnt allow that. You have to buy the ringtone from iTune.
ok guys i need ur help asap.. i got the i phone 2 days ago.. its really nice.. i like it but wut i dont like is that we cant use the bluetooth :S anyways my question is HOW CAN I CHANGE THE RING TONE??? I WANT TO PUT IT AS A SONG NOT THEIR STUPID SONGS.. HOW???
it has  Bluetooth but it can be use only to connect to the hands free and car kit,you can't send or resive and data,but don't worry its upgratable in feautre.
does it hav bluetooth and can u use it to send musoc and videos and stuff . sahame it aint out in england yet!!!!:( anyway needs answeereeingg pleezz thanks people

I have been using a hacked iphone for the last 3 weeks. My honest review before you ppl putting any bad comments on this phone please use it before say a word. pdf viewer, word and excel no problem. Once it launch worldwide other phones manuf. will feel the heat from iphone competition. Finally, you need to be a Mac user to fully utilize the phone and appreciate it.
personally I think the iphone is excellent, you all need to remember that this is only the first gen of this handset think of how good this is now and then think how awesome its going to be in 1 years time and how good apple are at updating their products based on custoner feedback.  Im sorry but I work for a mobile phone company and all of you who are claiming that the N95 is better must be mental!  the amount of these handsets that end up faulty due to the rubbish that nokia put in and on them is shocking.  iphone rocks!!
I heard that in Chicago the iPhone costs'round $375, is that true
iphone is real fast compere to any other phone in market,its realy nice.screen is verey big and it has protecting shild on it,its only sensetive to finger(skin).8gb is enough for ur video's and ur musics,utube is like nothing else u have seen before.the menu is real easy to use.so if u want to by it think about what it has,not about what it doesnt have.i m sure u like it verey much.I also don't have to touch my phone while driving thank's to voice dialing on my n95 with my contact's and my wep 200 bluetooth. oh sorry i forgot, no voice dialing on the iphone.
Hi All, I have most mobiles in the market from all brands Nokias, mOTOS, sE, samsung, Htc, imate......no phone is perfect, but all is an experiance on its own. some bad some amazing, but at the end its the passion to try every mobile that comes out. trust me when i say The iphone is an experiance that i enjoyed most. you are sacrfising alot of features like good cam, files BT transfer and 3rd party apps. but you are gaining alot of new stuff that will blow your mind away. just try it and you will know. but to apple poeple 3G was something i didnot get why you missed also MMS would have been great to have here.
To lapus red. can you do skype calling on your e90 or voip and if so can you see the other person you are talking to. just wanted to know cause i have n95.
Really, guys, Iam  an Iphone user, and even  though bluetooth connection is only available for headsets ,you must accept that style design , touch sreen technology ,qwerty keyboard 16M color screen, large 3.5 " inches, is better than others moile devices.  Its great and cool but not seem exciting!

i had N95 and i exchange it 4 times...why ? because the made cheap plastic keypad and loose slider..what about battery ?? ok...If you use Internet all day, i mean 12 hours, so, all kind of batteries will die..Iphone battery is same..I use all day with Internet, and I'm happy....

the touch screen when i saw it was kinda cool but overall the i phone isn't my cup of tea. n95 for me all the way.
There is also the applications issue I noticed that some screensavers

use a lot of juice.
Base on my opinion, the battery life of the Iphone is very good compare to other smart phones out there in the market. I owned several PDA phones and I can't compare to my Iphone. The only thing I noticed in the Iphone's battery power is,  it consumed more power when I use the Edge network to retrieve email and internet bowsing, other than that it works well. I normally charge the battery every 2 days (it depends how you use the Edge network). I hope this information will help you.



More on the battery issue, there is a reason why the battery cannot be changed by the user, I think it is because they want to avoid

third party suppliers batteries, this is a leading edge device that uses a lot of power and the legal liabilities that come with battery life and use better be sealed in the unit at the factory.....
Honestly the Iphone will give you barely one day of full usage, it has a large display that uses a lot of juice, I had one for a month and I say it it sufficient but not exciting.

Better have a car charger just in case....
Seems like this topic is not even touched on much.



Can any iphone users comment on the battery life of this phone on a single charge.



Pls do not quote the specs from apple webby, as you all know that can never be the honest truth.



So whats the batt like with the usage or internet/music/video/sms etc.
I recommend this as Iphone owner..Buy iphone and keep it, because very soon you will pay again more then 500.00..This phone will be updated very soon with allot of programs..You know? who cares you saying sucks about iphone ?? This is the best technology phone this days and perfect size..You will miss..
for all the peeps that think iphone sucks its because either you cannot afford it, haven't used it before just watched the youtube clips or trying to defend your current phone even though you know it sucks
e90 is good but very big and heavyweight 132 x 57 x 20 mm, 140 cc and 210g, for me i prefer iphone
Iphone sucks t688 sucks all pne sucks except e90
njnc said the truth and mfgm is blocked.
Here the BIG news :

Apple, Orange to sell unlocked iPhone in France

By Jim Dalrymple



Apple and its wireless partner in France, Orange, will sell an unlocked version of the iPhone, a spokeswoman for Orange confirmed to the International Herald Tribune. The unlocked iPhone will carry a premium price, although the companies did not say how much more it would be.



Apple is being forced to sell an unlocked iPhone in France because of a French law that forbids bundling the sale of a mobile phone and a mobile operator. As announced yesterday, iPhones locked to the Orange network will cost ï¿½399 or about US$565.

Who says France is not good ?
Very nice defend, then as they made the best mobile device ever,

and that is  from a company with ZERO mobile experience, you wold think that the " big mobile guys " should be able to do much better.....
t688 issssss badddddd,the worse in the world,dont compare with iphone,apple is much better than chinese t688 jajajajaja think about it
to  njnc

tv mobile t688 the best phone ever made.

buy it from ebay seller hitechhkN95 is cheap plastic OK ???  Iphone is the best today in the market..any way with N95 you not gonna use 3G, if your provider is different..
the iphone is too overrated.

i had this phone for a day and i switched back to my N95.
i Purchased iphone yesterday ana i Sold it today back to n95 whatever you say ...this version still testing version i will wait the new iphone version with gps and 3g( built in )  and good camera maybe 3 mp and its work with every networks not like now we must unlock the iphone to use it and we cant upgrade the new versions till some hacks work about it
just thought Id post my 10pence worth having used iphone for a week. It's a really good phone and I like the way its very stable. The only bummer is sending, recieve, storing and accessing cannot not be done without 3rd party apps which is a bit crap. My n95 did all this with ease. that being said this phone still rocks and cant wait forapple to release the sdk next year. It rocks with the apps that are available now but next feb it will rule.
Can i be compared with the Tytn II? No,, its just a good replacement for Nokia users.



Getting an Iphone is like stepping out from a Maybach to Toyota Supra.. Fun to drive but Maybach is Maybach..



I was owner N95 2 months, and i replace it 5 times..Because nokia made this phone with cheap plastic materials, very bad loose slider, it was Turing OFF and ON by it self 3 times a day..And now i have the best phone...IPHONE
Right guys, wats going on with this iphone, wats it all about, is it a waste of time and money or wat, talk to me guys tell me wats goin on. iv got my n95 so im waiting for the n95 8gb  to come out or the iphone, so im in 2 minds nw.
No, you cant transfer any thing by blue-tooth...You can use only bluetooth with your headset..This is not regular blue-tooth,,,
Guys i have a couple of questions.. you cant transfer ANYTHING by bluetooth? no contacts , pictures, notes ..etc ??? also i cant use any of the music stored on the 8GB as a ringtone???
hw do i tranfer contacts frm a nokia to iphone n hw can i forward a message
i don't give a rat's a..s how much a phone sell's i care what a phone can do for me in term's of spec's and quality and feature's. This is the N95. Now also N95 8gb with double the ram.
njnc. i don't steal from other phone's to make ringtone's i can get them thru bluetooth, but you can get ripped off by paying for your music if you like, that's the way apple want's it.
The truth will be on monday :

Apple will report their Q4 financial results on October 22nd at 2pm Pacific time and 5pm Eastern time. The conference call will be webcast live ...



Like it or not this is what is happening on the market :

iPhone top seller for AT&T

As reported by DigiTimes, ï¿½ ï¿½the iPhone has become AT&Tï¿½s top selling device, commanding some 13% of AT&Tï¿½s overall handset sales, and the fourth top selling handset in the US market,ï¿½ according to Barry Gilbert, VP of the Strategy Analytics BuyerTRAX programs.ï¿½ Whatï¿½s more, DigiTimes also quotes Gilbert as indicating that ï¿½ ï¿½ the sales trajectory we are observing with the iPhone could make it the top selling device in the US over the next 1-2 quarters.ï¿½ ï¿½ [Oct 19, 2007]

And that is without blue tooth file transfer, tiny speakers, no3G

no interchangable battery,

but a lot whole more in terms of overall user experience.
Read the open letter on the Apple site about 3rd party applications coming officially in February, Apple is doing things professionally and legally, just like they did with the Itunes music stores that quickly became number one in the world.

You can make ring tones legally, or you can steal with other phones, but the law is catching up, and the market is certainly rewarding apple's policy , compare how their shares are doubling every year and more...
No games, no fun. My top concern is that we can not install 3rd party applications. i don't think if i can live with this device.
so far. i phone=no transfer via bluetooth, no 3g, no video recording, no voice dialing, 150.00 to get unlocked, can't replace battery by yourself, although i've heard why,becuse of aftermarket battery's, can hardly hear music with such a tiny speaker, 2 meg camera, not 5, can't apply song's as ringtone's, navigation will not talk to you. i was told this by someone who own's i phone.
To: Kapil - you can not transfer any stuff via bluetooth.  The bluetooth that comes with the unit is for headset only.
Try it for a week and then you will see, it is show and can't do without ,  my old Nokia E61 with 3G is a stone age tool in comparison !
sure iphone looks cool.

but people, no mms? no voice dialing?



and most of all no 3G?



come on.



no 3G no go.



as said, iphone's a device that states



all show and no go.guys well i will be buying the i phone tom and i have n95 aswell so happy with 2 best phones r mine....well read a lot about iphone but i think a person who knows about high teck phones will be able to use the i phone with ease and people who have never used touch screen phones or highteck ones will not like iphone, thou iphone does not have few feature its ok coz lot of people dnt use them, theonly thing they shld have given bluetooth transfer.......gonna rock with my new baby ( I PHONE )

Im sure you not gonna use it and YOU CANT use it when you drive the car..Because i had N95 and i paid 700.00 before..You need GPS? go buy from stores for your car, but GPS in the phone ??? i would say this is something funny, because no one cant use it when he or she driving that car..Be aware from ACCIDENT...

http://discussions.apple.com/t...adID=1030550
i phone sells alot cause people do not realize until after purchase that it will not do all these things that n95 will do. People only hear touch screen. Well wip de do.
can anyone help! what can i do when my iphone suddenly  frozen i did't drop it.. it just got frozen the when i woke up! HELP!
i'am having a great time with my n95 i can listen to music thru bluetooth headphone's which you can't do with i phone. i can hear music without headphones cause it has volume iphone no volume. i can record video's on n95. take a picture outside during the day and you will find it's 5 meg, just look at the kb's. it's sometime's at 1500kb's. Just because i phone sell's alot do you want a phone that every one else has, then it's not unique anymore and it is so cliche!!!
In case anyone is wondering, the iphone has a 1400 mAH battery.
This is a great phone.



Sure it has its issues. No MMS. Cant directly pull off data/use as a hard drive (possible throgh ibrickr though). No video. No bluetooth A2DP (this one really stinks heh) or file transfer.



But,



Its easy and intuitive to use. Easy enough that it dosent even come with an instruction manual. Third party apps available now which will enhance its functionality. Excellent music capability. Awesome video playback. Finger operatd touch screen which, (I believe I speak for most iphone users here), if used once, users will not want to revert to a traditional hardware keypad.



And,



Its got class. It turns heads, which is more than I can say for most new traditional phones on the market. Simply, because its different.



I've owned several different nokia, sony ericsson and imate phones preiously and I could always think of another phone I would upgrade to in a flash. However, this time round i would be far more reluctant, at least until we have more phones on the market which are as user friendly and interactive.



IMHO, the benefit and pleasure of using an iphone, especially at its current price greatly outweigh the disadvantages.
CAN i use a song as a ringtone? and isit true that one cannot Forward a SMS which is already present in SMS???
i need to know if the tones are loud?and can i transfur the songs to be the tone of the people?
why iphone no have VDO recorder ? Why they put 4, 8 GB of memory but can't record. upset

please let me know ....

thanks in advance
hey to be honest it has verey good quality sound but its not verey loud because there is one speaker and its not verey big.but while using hands free u really going to love it.
see to be honest the sound quality is not bad but its not verey loud because there is only one speaker and its not verey big,while using hands free its real good,and by the way its my email(souranus@yahoo.com) if you have any thing to aske I will be happy to answer you and be helpfull
Hi, guys

I just would like to know the iphone has a good sound and surround when you  listening to music or use hand free.

and anyone please mail to me, thank you in advance.

Adam Sthis phone is not worth any money i bought it for $6500 tt yes i am in Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean if you did not know.when i turned it on it said Error please restart phone to fix problem if problem persists contact your dealer.i did what it said but it did not work and i went by my dealer which is bmobile and they said they had to reinstall the interface but they could not!!! total waste of money you should know this from APPLE!!!
To RNjoe. thank's for your help in commenting on the i phone, people who like nokia must stick together!
Enough N95 and iphone bashing already. TO each his own. N95 has many features iphone does not have. On the other hand iphone is more user friendly. It depends entirely on what the user is aiming for.



Also dont forget that while the N95 is much more capable than the iphone in many ways, it is also more than twice as expensive. So on a value for money basis they're probably both at the same level.
Moreover Apple just got started on the phone market with this unbelievable success, guys like Nokia with more than a decade experience will have a hard time to follow suit, but at the end of the day we will all benefit from this competition and the phones will get better and better, no competition and phones will still have abig dial pad and a black and white tiny screen, remember those days ?
You do not have to buy the Iphone, it is a free market that decides to buy or not to buy, and the market is buying at this price millions of Iphones that means that people are satisfied with this product at this price, like it or not,

just a fact of like, if you do not like it get a Nokia.
Some guys here are talking about the raising quantity of Apples share.

Dudes ain't that our money by which we are buying there product and raising there shares?

Iphone is not cheap at all.By paying that much money why can not i get decent cell phone which atleast have the properties of a low end mobile phone.

I aint here to bash it. But aint it true that this phone cant even forward a simple sms.

When the phone hangs you have to hard restart the phone and have to loose all your data.

It has a camera marked as 2 mpx.After experiencing the camera i should say it should have been stated much lower than 2 mpx.

And now comes the part about the music quality of an ipod,let me ask all of you guys something have anyone of you ever compared the quality of sound between an ipod and an Creative Zen, if you did not than do it after reading my comment,you will see my point.

Apple has done something decent by puting a vast capability of internet experience but apart from that there is nothing more to be proud about.

Every body here knows wat apple can do. So everyone should wait for the next update of phones from them.

And one more thing. As much as i love apple i love nokia too. The different brands are not bashing each other so why should we.

Apple has done a good job but their job aint complete yet on this phone,so lets wait and see.

And another request to some guys out here please stop bashing N95,it is one of the complete phone ever and its very very good.

Take case guys.
Apple should stick to makinh ipods and computers and leave the phone buisness to someone else ....and about Nokia ....they are better off servicing the chinese markets.....cheers!!!
To RNjoe:

see we dont care of u like iphone or not but we like it and dont say something about it when u r not sure.

You need to know this:

1.the is file browser software which is downloadble and its working verey fine

2.web browser is very fast atlist i am sure its faster than nokia

3.keyboard is very nice and smooth and in between all touch screen mobiles in market iphone's keyboard is the best because its big a you can use it easily.

4.you can use i phone with one hand

5.the ring tone can be changed using (ibrickr) software

6.the alert tones can be change using summerboard software which is in the list of iphone installer

7.wallpaper can be changed and viewed using customiz software

8.there is PDF viewer software

9.zooming photos can be done using one hand because by duble taping on photo u can zoom it

10.there are games which you can donwload in the list of iphone installer

SO PLEASE DOT say any thing
i think this phone is very very good,but i prefer to buy nokia n95,because the price is very high for iphone ,and it is locked.
Market success is measured in Wall Street not on blogs by envious

people and the numbers on Apple shares are simply staggering, be smart and buy soma Apple shares and enjoy the good life.
You could write a whole bible but IPHONE is VERY successful,  like it or not and there is nothing you can do to change the facts of life.
soo

you carnt send files via bluetooth

you have to pay to have a mp3 ringtone

is this true

can an iphone user please guide if its possible to download ringtones on iPhone ? Awaiting for correct replies.



Rohan
Too bad that they are selling millions of these phones and APPLE shares record an all time high every day, your opinion does not really matter to their outstanding success.
This is the worst phone in the world. It should get destroyed, burned, and should disappear from the face of the Earth. The iPhone only brings back nightmares. It should be called the iSuck because it does indeed suck!!!



Nokia is the best. After the horrible iPhone experience, I will definitely-- absolutely get the Nokia 8Gb. Why did I waste my money on this piece of crap. Touch screen is sucks. Not reliable whatsoever.
i don't need a Ipod with phone functiong

i need a phone with Ipod functions



this phone is good, i plaied around for 1 hour and i love it but it's litle bit too big!



not realised at Aus yet but still can get a unlocked iphone, best phone to me is 6110 nav
Hey all, i work for Apple and all I can say is most of our sales of this phone have been consumed by the younger generation.



Only buy this phone if u need an ipod (and u dont have one)



other then that, this phone is useless in the phone world
Im gonna buy this soon guys.. an unlocked one! cant wait to brag it to my friends.. lol.. Im a music lover. that's why Im getting it.. 8gb here I come!!!
look allan ,i only said n95 is old,but have severals good features,iknow that,plastic is not so good,slide neither,but i like the n95,thats serius ,but iphone is a ipod with phone and is excelent in that point of view,is the fashion future....both are wonderfull,,,,peace too
Who wants a phone that doesn't even have bluetooth?? I mean come on now. This is 2007.Keep your N95 Apple does not have enough phones to fill the market request, maybe one day it will happen for the N95 but I doubt it :





Published reports over the weekend have said the company will limit customers to purchases of two of the devices, and that they will have to use a credit or debit card to buy them.



The move is purportedly an effort to ensure that customers won't be disappointed this holiday season, though the restriction does seem to fly in the face of the notion that U.S. currency is "legal tender for all debts public and private."



Still, it's not as if there aren't millions and millions of other phones out there for credit impaired customers to buy.



I WILL STICK TO THE N95. Got an apple i-phone and it is not all that great. Got it from America thinking it would be amazing from all the ratings but was so disappointing. Its not user friendly AT ALL. So confusing to use. I put 5GB of music on the phone and it barely worked. VERY VERY SLOW.

!!!!!!!WARNING DONT BUY ONE!!!!!!!
i'am not crying about anything. Stop complaining about n95.
only one thing i want to tell about this is it is a superub
lol.....Ok now we know that iphone is the best,

since iphone iran has had the experiment of dropping it and , "she is still alive." Anybody willing to test the iphone dropping it in water or under a tank , please post ur  opinion and let us all know what a great machine this is.
WOW, just switched from N95 to iphone, in my opnion for sure iphone is way better even not having all the functions N95 offers, but quality means alot to me and N95 quality is bad when compared with iphone. I was unhappy when i bought N95, isnt all the stuff ppl says about it, now i'm really pleased with my iphone, it's damn good on everything it does.
Hi Guys

yeah the iphone NOW isnt greenphone but its really fantastic

this morning i dropped it DOWN :D

SHE IS ALIVE :))

i lov it

really fantastic phone really
I-phone is consider not a green phone by greenpeace... i hope they could make their phone green like nokia and other brand... i would definitely buy one...
600$ for that?!?!I'll go NOKIA
The only problem I have with the iphone is the tariffs it's going to be avalible on the 9th november with o2 as it's o2 exclusive in the uk



You won't be able to put a normal sim in the phone as the new o2 simcard size has been changed for that pacific phone.



The tariffs are expensives.



when your 18 months contract on the phone is up and you decide to cancel the contract the phone can only be used as a ipod as the phone features will turn into a brick.



So you guys who are thinking of unblocking the iphone with a o2 contract it's impossible.



and the phones doesn't have a flash player on so some applications on the phone will not work when browsing.



However the batterylife on the h/set is probably the best out there.



Ups mms and 3g isn't on the iphone



iphone is good! style and performance is good! i like it very well! most specially the wifi! guys try it! i'm sure you've loved it!
hi guy

To se23:

Sir, I suggest you try a Pocket PC phone, maybe  then you will know what I mean. In my earlier post i said its a great device, but it still lags behind pocket pc phones. But still i do believe that its the matter of taste.

To irani iphone:

So buy another phone. Why are you crying.
i phone has nothing to offer to nokia user's. No music bluetooth, no fm radio, no voice dialing and the list goes on. Only eye catching for people who do not know about good specification's in a phone.
well saeed I wanted it because of looks and I have been using for a few weeks now and although file transfer is not as easy as my n95 this phone flippin rocks. I love most things about it. The question is what do you want from a phone? ask yourself that question before you buy any phone. Oh yeah if Apple do release a new phone I will get it cos of this one, and my next laptop WILL be a MAC
Success and sales mean everything not specs  Iphone Iphone Iphone
Nice iranian Iphone user, all the best !!!!!!!!

has anyone heard any information on a 3G and WiFi iPhone coming out anytime soon? I've heard a lot of rumors that I should wait for the 3G version of this phone to come out, which is why I still have not purchased it.

To: nhk - thanks for your response. As I understand with your reply, iPhone will not locked using Wi-Fi, this is what I'm scared of.  Yes, a lot of hotspot to access WLAN here in our area.  In fact, my unit was also bought from Bahrain and we are only neighbour (Saudi Arabia).  Well, I'll try the Wi-Fi and I will let you know.
Man this phone is awesome.. the touch pad is amazing. this baby is worth every cent u spend on it... the features are good. the screen is crystal clear. the sound quality is good. the phone is a piece of envy for every one who doensnot have it....

i phone rox
iran phone said the truth for me APPLE " Iphone " = LEXUS ( lux. phone like LEXUS , really special).i love that phone,because is something new in tecnology,big and bright touchscreem,good ipod inside,fast wifi,etc..
i just received my iPhone last week.

it great! the screen resolution is CRYSTAL CLEAR!! web browser is superb!
This is a great phone! Nothing like it.
To MsNF,



Sorry i forgot to tell you my software version its 1.0.2 like i said i haven't updated it cause it would ruin my iphone for me.. until its internationally used then i can update it



nhk
To keith marshall,



no there's no radio in iphone



nhk
To Arc,



Yes i have tried the Wi-fi it works great and very simple :) I have tried it at home, and at other networks too and it works perfectly.. You are right about using the iphone to access internet the screen is a heaven crystal clear and the zoom-in/out is so easy no annoying buttons or clicks it discreetly lets you browse the net and type as much as you want :) there's also a youtube icon on the desktop (if you're interested you can easily log on to it and enjoy the videos:) )

so basically if you have a access to an open WLAN you wont have a problem browsing the net..



hope i helped :)



nhk
To MsNF,



when i got this phone i've been told not to update the software to the latest since the phone isn't "legally unlocked" so i just used it the way it is for the time being i'm sure its just a matter of time till we can update it regularly.. and about the ringtones unfortunately you cant do it on your own just yet but again i've heard of a shop in w-riffa that do that not only ringtones but themes and games too.. itunes icon does appear on the screen and about the warranty well bahrain's apple shop are not helpful at all either way i mean wether you buy it from them or not.. but to answer your question sadly no warranty unless you buy it & use it in the states.. i took my chances and brought it and frankly i dont regret it :D



oh i must mention that there's an installer on the screen desktop where you can install couple of programs ( not all of them are safe) you can look up in arabic forums for details or ask me here i'd be glad to help :) those programs include an arabic keyboard (but the problem is the each letter is typed separately..



hope i helped you :)
My keypad isn't loose or broken slider and i don't feel at all that the material's are cheap. i have seen loose slider's , but those were the dummy one's in the cell store that aren't real and people are messing around with them alot.
I love Nokia always, but this time They made N95 very cheap plastic materials..Very loose keypad and broken cheap slider...Iphone is perfect..If you need good camera, so go buy Camera from store, and dont buy phone which including 5mp camera..This is phone and not camera..
Nokia=Merc S600 Guard

I work for a company in the Uk, and i have the I-phone to have a play about with for a while.



So far impressions - Really Good.



The things that stand out in this phone are:



- Safari browswer, without a doubt the best mobile web browser around, super sleek, fast and easy to use, nothing comes close so far.



- I-pod section of the phone fantastic, flipping through album art like the I-touch, 3mm headphone jak, loudspeaker is very quiet though for a music phone, through headsets, sound is top notch.



- Photo browsing is a delight, as well as watching videos, the screen is fantastic, crystal clear, nice and big, photo manipulaion is great fun, and the "Pinch" teechnology for zooming is ace.



Only had the phone for a few hours so far, some not so great aspects:



- The camera is poor, this isn't a camera phone, you shouldn't expect miracles and you won't get them. No video recording either.



- The handset itself gets very warm after only a few minutes of web browsing, nothing major but diffently wasn't expecting that amount of heat to be given off.



- Pre-selection of ringtones/message tones, pathetic in this day and age, the whole buying ringtones off I-tunes is another way to rip people off by apple.



- No multi-media messaging, dudes cummon, really dissapointing for a phone released in 2007.



- The handset it's self is very heavy, not horribly so, but still fairly chunky, its also a major fingerprint magnet.



Overall not a bad experience, but it's apples first go and they did a good job.

I think i'll wait for their 2nd attempt though.
if you enable 3rd party support for the iphone YOUR WARRANTRY IS VOID. Do not do this, especially if you know anything about apple. lots of apple products break before warrantry. e.g., my ipod shuffle did. only way to repair is send off to apple, who will know you installed 3rd party applications, and will NOT repair your phone, as the warrantry is VOID.
rolythebest:



I'm not sure where you got your information, but it's obvious you never actually used the phone. The UI is VERY user friendly.. in fact, that's one of the most touted benefits of OS X.  I was able to hand the phone to my gf's mother who hasn't used anything other than a simple simple phone for her entire life, and she was able to navigate around, play with pictures, and everything with ease.



The picture quality is amazing for a 2MP camera, and it is very easy to use with one hand. Maybe you have tiny tiny hands, in which case I can understand.



And, most important, it's VERY easy to enabled 3rd-party support. Sure maybe it's not officially supported yet, but it works now, and in February, Apple is releasing their SDK which does nothing but welcome MORE 3rd-party developers.



All in all, it's a great, easy to use phone, with a slightly-expensive yet easily justifiable price, IMO.
hii all



i want to ask all of u that have the iphone how can u got new ringtones or pic or..... without having bluetooth ?? i mean if ur friend have nice ringtone and u want it can u get it , and can u downlaod somethings from the computer to it using the cable ??



waiting for u



thxx
Iam sick of hearing about n95,had it sold it because of the usual probs thats been stated over and over again..



The rzr v3 come out with 5mb memory and could not video record till a software upgrade allowed it too,it has vga camera,low res screen, so how come its sold over 100 million fones ?? Its the design of it and it was gorgeous and so is i phone so it will sell too.. not everybody wants top camera and so on!! most people only want all bells and whistles to show off they never really use them realistically..The i-phone is a materpiece and things will improve when third party apps come along ,,,,just remember some people in my area still use n3310 and it does wat they want which is talk and txt so why should the i phone have to do  everything its good at the features it has and if its not to your spec then there are 100s of other fones to choose from
The i phone doesnt do anything amazing that no other phone doesnt do, What the big fuss?
I had many phones past 2 years, i mean all kind of brands..Last one was N95 and i keep it about 1 month..It was great phone, but i didnt like the cheap keypad and loose slider, and also it was Restarting by it self 2-3 times each day..Now i have Iphone about 1 month, and this is perfect..I know there is no Blue-tooth, no mms or video recording, but still im happy with this phone, because i don't need video or mms..For video recording i have perfect video camera, and for bluetooth, i can use my headset with iphone..Im sure you not using mms, bluetooth ( picture transferring) or video recording every day..
that phone is amaizing,cool.i dont care it dont  have video record because i have a video camara,and actually not exist phone that record videos good,for that record videos isnt important ,i think a good phone has to have a good reception,good screem resolution ,fast wifi,looking COOL,NEW TECTOLOGY,16M RESOLUTION OF COLOURS AND BRIGHT,EXCEPTIONAL TOUCH ECREEM EXPERIENCE....  I AM VERY HAPPY WIHT MY IPHONE
No video recording??? You must be joking! Even a two-year-old N70 shoots video nicely. I live in Cambodia and there are iphones for sale here with considerably high price. When i went to check it and played around with it for a while, i decided to stuck with my old and stable Nokia.



Big, High price with no 3rd party software support with no video with unacceptable pic quality with NON-FRIENDLY UI... then it just a piece of crap... Consider before you buy one.



Plus, you would have no chance to control you FABULOUS iphone with ONE hand... you must use both to hold it and touch it. You'll find this small stupid solution annoys you everytime.



Why not using the phone from experience manufacturers instead of a company which just made a phone yesterday and sell for high price? Consider for a while and you'll think we've been cheated.
The iphone is going to be big, Really can't see people sleeping outside the store for days though wanting the iphone  i've been playing with one for at least 3 weeks now at work and it's a fantastic h/set so i'm going to wait a while for one pacific reason.



There's dis & advantages about the phone which all h/sets have for example the tariff prices and the phone doesnt have access to mms and 3g network and of course after the 18 month contract and u cancel u contract the phone features becomes a brick as you can't use the phone with another simcard with o2



Advantages is of course the battery life and the touch screen is quite cool, internet browser is good might go to franch and get one as it's illegal to lock phones over there to just one network so it will be a sim free phone
im thinking about buying an Iphone. but ive read all the comments.. and many says the iphone sucks. does it get messed up alot? or... does it work fast?
Just to settle about the N95, great phone on paper. I work in a mobile shop, not so great on reliabilty, constant freezing, software issues and all round problems, a real headache. Iphone has not been released here yet (Australia) but if it is anything like an ipod i hope my store doesn't sell it. Most reliable phones over the past 2 years (in my store) have been Samsung with the worst two being Motorola and LG, and nokia are getting poorer and poorer as time goes on. Would like to try an iphone, hoping it really does have something going for it... Rumour has it, in australia the iphone is coming out on the 3G network (from what i've heard from reps etc.) this would be interesting, though i doubt this is true.
stone me lol i meant uk
sorry last post to saeed
to sawed



Try a pocket pc! LOL I have been using phones since the last 15 or so years I had mobile before many people in un even before sim card was introduced. I've had many pocket pc intact most Mda that came out on t-mobile uk. The thing with iPhone is its really special its like nothing I've ever used before and sdk not even released yet. So yeah most phones on the market can do a lot of crap but iPhone is a new experience for me. And trust me I hack phones to death so I guess I'm in a good position to make this statement. Beware tho people reception is mad if you grip the bottom of iPhone while talking.
Hiya! I need to know. Does apple iphone have video?.. and also could you put broadband onto this thing? email me because I need to know now.. thanks!
bgj7. Why would this other be envious he has the n95. Great phone.
people here are comparing the first apple mobile phone with the media monster of the leader in the mobile industry (N95)

but its not right they are both from different categories as the iphone is a touchscreen device and it is intended for the touchscreen users it came to revolutionize the pocket PC and microsoft's Windows mobile platform and in my opinion apples UI is a lot better than W.M (windows mobile ) UI any way N95 was meant for the people who wants something that does it all BUT are you going to use it all??? i had the chance to get N95 or W850i and i chose W850i as it has what i need without taking the luxury of battery life and frankly i dont see where N95 is superior to w850i other than the screen ??T-rex you need to check your training. You can only return the iphone if you change your mind if you got it online!
Credit checking will be much easier to pass for those who have bad credit ratings :-)



No You can return the h/set within the 14 days of purchasing the iphone and for those who are buying the h/set for a present and are over the 14 days they will be given a voucter which will enable you to return your h/set if your not happy for what ever reason.



The scoring criteria on equifax has also been placed



I've had the Iphone training so who ever is saying you can't send the phone back once bought for what ever reason must be well confused or stupid :-)



Also bear in mind once you cancel your contract adfter the 18 months your h/set will become a BRICK and you will only beable to use the iphone as a ipod :-) hope you all have a happy day



We got 5 demo units in the other day, but we can't show customers till launch. I am impressed with the handset, browsing on the net is really easy. Athough it's a bit odd that you can't view youtube using the built in browser, but then again I guess that's why there's a seperate youtube button.
i had my iphone for 4 day's now..i recently has N95, i show my iphone to my friend im very proud of showing it..and he show's me he's fake touchscreen china phone..man that thing has bluetooth transfer and the volume is much much louder to my iphone!!! and tv receiver too!!!! that crap china phone has more function than my iphone!!why apple... why!!!??
does anyone know how to watch video on safari in iphone..plz help me..
The iPhone is being launched at 6.02pm on Friday 9th November, I'm sure you can work out where the 02 came from!
to the person who made the comment about returns,you can only return the iPhone if you fail the credit check on itunes and have proof!
If the iphone had a +5 Megapixel camera, 3g and mms capabilities and a flashplayer then I would of definately of got the h/set.



I'm going to get a ipodtouch which is the iphone but without the phone.



I'll stick with my N95 for now until sony or Nokia bring out a killerphone
i had my iphone for 4 day's now..i recently has N95..the iphone is undoubtedly beautifull. but man it's no comparison to N95.. i miss my bluetooth file transfer..and the simple way of forwarding a message is not available..i want file transfer via bluetooth it's very important to me. i use it to my work.
to se23,,another thing is s/e fans keep buying the same old thing only slightly better specs and just become bored after few hours, same as n95 before that they bought n73 n80 etc no different really,,wat they dont do is broaden their horizons and try something different like ive just bought the o2 cocoon and its brilliant and totally different and thats my point,,,,your not buying this for top secs your getting a new interface etc with gorgeous screen,,something completely new..After this i may get a blackberry cause ive never used one and it will be a new experiance again...



So wat im saying is this ia new in its class its different from wat you hav used before and thats the point and altho i have not seen it in flesh or held it it just is such a smooth phone but coming from a new angle just like the new b&o/samsung seranata its just something different from the norm
yeah all you haters talking crap. I had n95 and iphone dont have all its features but the the iphone is a masterpiece. I love it and have no plans to trade it in or sell. It reminds of when I used to visit the n95 thread and people talking rubbish about the n95 on there. Just give up and get a hobby. research the phone if ur ok with specs go for it. If not shut up! I personally dont go onto other threads and talk crap. And God is not an issue here so why go there.
Does it have eyelet for a lanyard so it can be hung from neck please
There are some crackpots on here ,,if you do not like it go away stop boring us,,anyway in Preston it says on sale after 6.02pm but could not get in shop it was too packed but does this mean friday or thursday after 6.02pm????

cannot wait !!! its still a unique gadget, bog off if you do not want it or hate it it will sell and people will be impresed
To the guy moaning about the O2 tarrif's sucking.



You get unlimited data and wifi usage with the tarrif's.



It would cost you MORE to go onto a normal tarrif and get an ulimited data bolt on than what the I-phone tarrifs give you.

So you are saving money.....



Plus the deals had to be agreed apon by Apple, as they get a "fair" cut of the profit, so if you think the packages suck, it's Apple who are responsible.
For the guy who said who cares about the other unique features, q} something.



Hello its a phone, I personally use multiple message sending, MMS and bluetooth file transfer alot so what the point in having a phone that doesnt do anything I want it to. The iphone is a step backwards for the Euro market not forward.



In the UK everyone has a 14 day return period, I predict major sales boom for the iphone followed by an immense return of the phone back to the dealers when everyone finally notices all of its flaws.



The phone is fine for the american market, but Euro phones are so much more advanced. This iPhone will sink like a lead ship in the Japanese market. Phones there have had TV, 5+ megapixel cameras and mobile broadband for years. 4G is already being developed out there.



Though to UK and Euro customers looking to buy it still, wait for the Nov 29 release in France. You will be able to buy an officially unlocked version of the iphone because it is against the law in France to lock any mobile to a singular network. UK customers will be able to get the handset cheaper through the exchange rate and you can just bring it back to England and stick any sim card you like inside it to use, so no need to sign up to new O2 price plans.





yep now there are loads of fakes about now of the t-phones and i-phones,  and yet you people still buy this crap your all nuts it's only a phone.... half you people don't know what your buying half the time your all mad crazy insane people just stick with your normal phone stop companys from becoming more rich from your pocket give it to a starving child...please do something with your lifes please
The most overated handset ever! Ive played with one of these and yeah its user friendly but its nothing special! No video,you cant bluetooth files to other handsets ( Apple control ) and the sound quality when played on the loudspeaker is poor! Save yourself ï¿½280 and get a Sony Ericsson K850i for nothing on a contract!
I was very lucky yesterday to play with the uk edition of the iphone and everything works brilliantly seemless o2 have done it well the edge was quick the only thing i found i didn't like was the texts it still no proper phone for that but they have ironed out all the bugs from the american 1 and is worth the money and i work in the mobile industry and have played extensively with n81 and w910i and they don't come close n81 is good but nothing compared to iphone
i bought an iPhone!

it was hack version and worked wit iranian telecomination sims

but iPhon sucks

it is a rubbish!

No send and receive of Data via bluetooth

No forwarding sms

NO Deleivery Report of sms

you cant change sms alert

you cant set coustom ring tone without pay to itunes

it is a rubbish

i hate it

i sold it


announced earlier today, a 7 day change of mind policy has been introduced, (but may go away again) however as previously mentioned, it has some really strict and as of yet unknown stipulations, one of which i would speculate that the phone is not even touched!
That is not actually true.... There is NO change of mind policy,



There is however a 7 day return if you have failed the credit check. You must provide proof that you have failed.



Thanks Craig
There is no IR and bluetoot file transfer, but the user interface and the overall consruction and ease  of use make it the best portable phone and internet device ever, Nokia has a LONG way to go to come even close the software make the difference and the way anybody can get to use it in seconds .....
Just found out that CPW are allowing a 7 day change of mind (subject to some very tight T&C`s). Dont yet know if this applies to Apple and O2 but I would guess it does.



This is still NOT a legal right thought T Rex. If you work in retail, and it seems you must, then your understanding of consumer law would be funny if it was not such a bad example of poor training/knowledge. I feel sorry for your customers and the bad advice they must be getting form you if you actually believe what you are saying is legally accurate. Check your facts on any consumer web site and you will see you are utterly incorrect.
In response to Rich and the post yesterday about the "law". Under UK consumer law you have no right at all to return goods if you change your mind after point of purchase. You have a right to return for exchange or refund if faulty but NOT for a change of mind. In regard to the iphone (and other mobile handsets) if you returned for refund due to a fault this applies to the product itself and NOT the contract. So if you returned an iphone that was faulty and did not want a replacement you would almost certainly still have to pay the contract itself.



It is a popular mis conception that you have a right to a change of mind, this is NOT the case. Please dont think that you do or it could become a VERY expensive home trial.



As to the distance selling act (buying online and over the phone) the legislation is actually 7 days NOT 14.



Anyone wishing to check this information can do so easily by going to consumerdirect.gov.uk.



Please, DONT buy things thinking you have a right to play with them at home and then return them. You don`t. Many shops DO allow this but many more DONT and it is NOT a legal right for the consumer.
There is no IR port to transfer the data and also the bluetooth is headset supported.

Why you want to spend so much money on this ..wait for Nokia 888.
ajay,

if india is rural then there'e no priority for wifi then you should know that india doesn't supports 3g services did ever made a video call in india iam also from india atleast now a days ppl do have a wifi network so kindly clear your doubts and iphone is a aweosome phone as it is already named a innovation of the year by time
I have only 2 days with my iphone and i am very happy fot my buy, people complain for the ipod even they dont know it, the browser internet is amazing its like a mac computer, i got firmware 1.1.1.and it is with no problem ( my iphone is unlocked) the only problem for me is the touchscreen its get dirty quickly =(
microsoft platform? why the hell would apple design something with a crappy windows operating system? thats like saying why dont nokia phones write samsung on the front. stupid...
"By law all companies must provide a grace period for products.



Online purchases normally have a 14 day return period because the consumer has not physically seen the goods at purchase, they may change their mind once they get their hands on it properly. Apple online purchases have this 14 day return period so I'm sure they'd offer it on their iPhone.



inn store purchases usually have a 7 day return period because you have seen the goods in person and chosen to buy it.



During these periods you can get an exchange or full refund if you have changed your mind. But the product must be in as new condition, any marks on it and you're stuck with it.



O2 CANNOT pick and choose which products they offer return periods too I'm afraid thats against the law.



But usually in both cases you have up to 28 days after the purchase to exchange the product if it is faulty."



Thats not true at all. no shop has to accept anything back for any reason otehr than if the product if faulty. And then only within the first 28 days,m after that its whatever warrenty the product comes with. Obviously if you buy online the law is different, but for shop no returns are nessecary by law at all. Get your facts right!



Iphone will have NO returns policy. Faulty exchange within 28 days, then back to apple for repair. Unless you fail the credit vet, in which case you have 14 days from then to return it to store for a refund, if you miss that dealine, you end up with a 145g, pretty looking paper weight!



The o2 t&cs are different for this one single product. Only this one.
You cannot 14 day your iphone if bought in a retail store. 7 day return on a Internet purchase (distance selling law).

Only retun reason is a failed credit check or a faulty return, Apple prodcuts generally have less than 1% faulty return and the fault would have to be seen in store before any return could take place.
just wondering if maybe t-rex works for o2, and rather than him just being arrogant and incorrect, that maybe o2 and carphone have a different policy?
T-rex your bang wrong! I have the T&C's in black and white,so I have facts rather than your opinion or what you believe to be true! Once again people there is NO 14 day return on iphone unless you have purchased online ( and then you only have 7 days ) or if you have failed the check and have proof!
Carphone legend did u used to work in phones4u by anychance? just wondering because you sound very confused.





It's a 14 days return with o2 stores and online read the back of the terms and conditions and you will see for yourself.



Or you could contact the A-team who will be taking all customer service calls for o2 iphone and i'm sure they will explain to you briefly, bit by bit, and very slowly for you in english that's it's a 14 day policy when you purchased the h/set and it's 28 days to return the h/set if faulty and they will swap it atraight away for a new one.



Ups the insurance policy as well,  I won't go too much into it but iphone has it's own insurance policy for those who want to take insurance,  you can only obtain it by contacting cust serv
and just to re-iterate, i do know that all other o2 connections have the companies standard 14 day policy on them, however the iphone is a multi launch, with a special deal done with both apple o2 and cpw, when they all sat down they all agreed the terms and conditions and this is where it differs from o2's usuall contracts, it is not just o2 controlling it is also apple. Infact i tell you what mr. rex, on friday a 6.02 go and pay 270 quid then try and take it back the next day, i sure know i won't be :)
Slim is right,if you want to mis-sell then do so but you will be the one with angry customers and the headaches! There is NO 14 day on iphones
it....is....not....a....normal.......o2....contrÂ­act......



and i merely mentioned orange because of the porevious comment saying that all networks have to by law offer a 14 day return. I have done the training and i do know what i am talking about, if you want to miss sell feel free, but i know who's gonna have more problems :)
With o2 it's a 14 days return weather it's been ordered online or bought from a store so instead of asking orange who hasn't got exclusive rights to the h/set in the uk as it's only exclusive to o2 in the uk ask o2



14 days policy so slim stop arguing and find out the real facts,  you've supposed to have had training lol
good phone i have two set. my brother has sent me this from UK.
1.Why no 3g?

2.Wifi is mostly of no use for for rural india which in fact a big market.

3.why o.s. Mac , prefferably it should be microsoft

* Do we expect new announcement from appleThe iphone has its advantages and limitations. I've used Nokia, Sony and others and they all have advantages and limitations. When you purchase an Apple product, (this being my first) I've noticed that you must purchase additional items to continue to upgrade the product or enhance it to continue its enjoyment. It's Apples way... Like it or not, it's how they make money. I got an iPhone as a gift. I had to change my contract, give up my discount, and was at first put off for all I had to do to use a phone. The bezel scratches easily, and applications are limited. Nevertheless, it's a good phone. By no way perfect, but by no way bad. Yes, the N95 and other phones have some better applications, but in the US the carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, etc have not improved their network to take full advantage of this. The iPhone is the first major phone to do what it can do with the network it was introduced with. In time I hope other networks will take note of this. Then perhaps I can use all the features on my N95 or some other phone I buy, not just a few. Take the phone for what it is. A phone that hopefully spark an entire new breed of products that will make the competition work harder, and networks work better at giving us,(the consumer) what we really want.
I have been reading lots of things pros, cons, anyway, what about the N95? is there any new model? man it has 5mp camera and all the stuff, i was about to buy iphone but all of a sudden saw the n95 geez!! =)
to trooper ,,thats wat i actually said did you read wrong post????I ve just come back from launch and there were 17 people there mostly women about 30 ish and a 50 year old plus me but others started to turn up as i left,i had a few minutes with it and he qwerty touch keypad is so biddy and on web browsing the colours bland and bleached out but there could be a contrast option dont know dont care..i not that daft to buy it,,its about one months free mortgage ï¿½269 plus another 18 months mortgage minus ï¿½35,, who does this steve jobs think he is ???
a big waste of time just a big hipe just like windows vista the batorey life is poor and its stolen from sony, lg , nokia
By far the best phone in the world.It's just...Apple!
compared to Nokia N95 what features doesn`t have?

pls some1 tell `cos soon I`m getting N95 or iPhone.

i know I can`t send mp3 thru BT or set as ringtone and about app are there any free or I have to pay for every single one?
Question. Does this phone support COMPLETELY Bluetooth hands-free usage for Car? I mean without any headset at all?
2 hours to go to be released in UK
If Brynn thinks that rubbish is true about 14 day exchange/return being set down in law then he should by one and try and return it 10 days latter. He will NOT get a refund or and exchange.



Quote directly from a UK trading standards leaflet:



"Please Note:

You have no right to return fault-free unwanted goods if you change your mind."



Its that simple and anyone who says otherwise has no idea what they are talking about. Any return policy other than faulty inside 28 days is down to retailer to decide.
can you change the keyboard configuration on your Nokia via software update ?
"If you buy Nokia you are screwed with what you get at time of delivery, with Apple step by step you get all the upgrades as they become available"



Erm... b0llocks. I have just purchased a Nokia 6500c and you can get firmware updates via the connection manager software or online. I am assuming that if my phone had a mobile internet connection, I might even be able to update the firmware automatically.



So please, pull the other one.
No 3G

No video recording

Unfriendly UI

Unfriendly text input method

Big and Huge

Must use with two hands

No support 3rd party softwares

Stupid design (you called this PHONE?)



With true of all listed above and you called it your dream phone... Oh Dummy people, keep dreaming.



I'm not an apple hater but i really could find any good points of this phone with god damn high price with useless features.



Every time you use it, you don't have any chance to do anything else. I mean, you have to hold and use with both hands. What if you use in hurry situatioins...?



PIECE of CRAP ROCK
this phone has the best design ever. it takes mobile phone to a new level but fails a lot in important areas. the touch screen is nice but may become a nightmare when texting(mainly long msgs or when you are in a hurry). even simple dialing can be tricky if you are not used to using this phone. secondly, the camera is so disappointing. a 2 mega pixel without autofocus, flash and i do not even tell you about the zooming. this is no match to SE camera phones. amazingly there is no video mode in this phone. this phone is definitely not a smartphone as far as applications and office tools are concerned. there is no 3g ie no video call.

my opinion , the iphone makes a revolution in terms of design but it ends here. that's a shame really
no 3 g support  booooooooooo
Nice to see that CPW employees know what they are talking about!!
Yo CPW Guy, you may wanna check the T&C again, if the customer changes their mind, they cannot return it within 7 days, they can if they purhcased it from direct, but not from retail.
If you buy Npkia you are screwed with what you get at time of delivery, with Apple step by step you get all the upgrades as they become available :

Alongside the iPhone 1.1.2 update, Apple has also released an iPod Touch 1.1.2 firmware update which is available for some through iTunes. For those who are impatient, a direct download is also available:



iPod1,1_1.1.2_3B48b_Restore.ipsw



Early reports indicate that the new iPod Touch update provides "Add Event" functionality to the iPod Touch, confirming an email exchange from Steve Jobs who promised that edit and add calendar events would be coming in a future software update. The lack of calendar editing had been described as a "bug" by Jobs.



It's a lovely handset, but not that powerfull in functions, as a HTC,or the Nokia E series and some other smartphones.I have my Nokia E65, ok,it's without touchscreen,but it has 3G and it's a great bussines phone, with Sym 60th,3rd series OS,so a lot of programs awailable.
goodbye iphone... it was nice knowing you. but im tired of the cat and mouse chase... besides, ive got Nokia to live with...
i bought i-phone oe month back and i am very satisfied with the features and the stlye . it is a unique piece and extra ordinary features and mind blowing clarity ,its quite stylish piece and center of attraction ....Aditudese23. then don't say that n95 is crap. good point about the large screen on the i phone. that's what i like to see ,when someone has a valid point instead of just saying sale's, but you might want to print those picture's out eventually and with a 2 as opposed to a 5 meg on a 4 by 6, well what will the quality be like. i had picture's printed out for the first time from my n95. i was surprised at how good they were and they were only 730 kb's. Wait till i print out the picture's from my other memory card, these picture's were 1400kb's.
All the early adopters of the iphone may want to stop reading this.



I have just found out that Steve Jobs intends to announce a 3G version of the iphone at his keynote speech at Macworld 2008.



On top of this several rumors sites for Apple have stated that on top of 3G we may finally get GPS built in!! Plus all the other things missing from this model will be rectified.



So early adopters in Europe, your phones will be out of date by January 2008, just 3 months into your 18 month contracts.



Apple have done this before with the iMac computers putting out a brand new update 3 months after initial release back in 2006 Macworld.
What do you all think of the i phone clones like cect p168. are they any good.
i work in phones 4 u down george street hove and i am really jelous that i cant sell the iphone. it is so sleek i love it so much. it is so much better than the phones we sell :(
my nem i sam oakes and i work in carphone warehouse. i dont usually get excited about phones but this one makes me twitch ;)
I love my iphone
iPhone is dangerous to your brain?



Posted by Will on Saturday, November 10th, 2007 at 5:34 pm under iPhone, Apple



iPhone radiation could be dangerousRight. The iPhone could be dangerous to your brain. But then, so could any other mobile phone. And, the complete opposite could be true - we just donï¿½t have any conclusive data one way or the other. That being said, The Register is reporting that replacement battery firm Exradia has called Apple out for ignoring ï¿½potential health issue[s]ï¿½ with the iPhone. As we all know by now, the iPhoneï¿½s battery is sealed inside the handset and isnï¿½t (easily) user replaceable. And, Exradia just launched a new line of mobile phone batteries with an integrated circuit that keeps your phoneï¿½s wireless radiation from wreaking havoc on your brain/DNA.



It looks like Exradiaï¿½s just playing up the potential danger of the radiation emitted by the iPhone to help sell a few extra batteries with integrated RF-absorbing juju. If you want to play it safe, just use a headset.
i also have no problem's with wi fi ,bg, my mp3 is also alot louder than your's with great quality. apple make's the i pod and this is the kind of music player they put in the i phone. bg, you have nothing to talk about with the i phone. that thing won't even fit into a shirt pocket it is so long and wide. my n95 fit,s in just fine. well i'am off to do some video recording of my son again with my phone! take a picture at night with the i phone, it has no flash or auto focus!!!
Today I was in a shopping mall waiting for my wife tried to get into WI FI with a Nokia E 61 impossible to do it, my Iphone went onto the WI FI network on its own, since I like to have a phone Internet device that serves me and not a device that drives me nuts without giving me the needed service i say IPHONE is the one, Nokia in the same league as PC where nothing ever works, gets viruses, drives you crazy with complicated software, but the average IDIOTSS keep on saying it is good except when they finally see you relaxed setting up and using excellent Apple products at your SERVICE !



"People, buy iphone, and if you don't like it, return it after 14 days, and go buy some other kind or brand phone..But i would say this..After couple of days, you will miss again iphone, and you will go buy again iphone..Because this phone really has a Magnetic skin, which mean, it can pull you in her body.."



Do you smoke crack?
just activated my new iphone .superb.dont be put off by n95 lot as i still have a n95 and iphone is superior.only thing is speaker used for music is quite distorted at full volume.overall 99 per cent.
dont be crazy to uy this phone its a resolution phone and limited options
People, buy iphone, and if you don't like it, return it after 14 days, and go buy some other kind or brand phone..But i would say this..After couple of days, you will miss again iphone, and you will go buy again iphone..Because this phone really has a Magnetic skin, which mean, it can pull you in her body..
Dont wait to 2nd iphone, and buy this iphone, because with this iphone you can update or upgrade all new futures and you dont need to pay 300.00 more to 2nd iphone..This is business, so they can make 300.00 more from peoples.
Apple are awesome but iphone is not very good. iphone revision 2 which will be out in autumn 2008 will be much better. I know 2 people on the iphone development team and they told me to wait for the second iphone. They said the features ready for the update will just blow everyone away.



One thing they did let slip is that the multi touch will evolve and include a sensor which reacts to how your fingers move over the screen without your skin actually coming into contact with it. So I could be moving my finger about and the iphone will sense my movement and perform an action. Think a along the lines Minority Report with Tom cruise who use those gloves to control the screens.



i phone has nothing. no camera auto focus, 2 meg not 5, no flash, no bluetooth transfer, nosms forward, no voice dialing, no navigation now that's a big one, no applying song's as ringtone's unless you pay pay pay, no video recording come on , even free cell phone's have this,150 dollar's to get it unlocked, mp3 player not very loud,phone must be sent in after a year to have the battery replaced and no sd card to take out to protect your private information, i phone is almost 1 foot in length and like 4 inches wide so don't talk about n95 being thick, no 3g, no a2dp. n95 n95 n95 has everything this i phone thing has nothing. apple of discord. even rating's on gsm arena are not as good as n95. spec's are important not sale's. apple has a big selection of phone's 1. i phone user's know it is to late to take this  so called cell phone back that is why the n95 pisses them off so much. for my last word's n95!!!
to bgj7,, the little touches do help the consumer a lot, even tho they do not consider it big at the time as in this instance yesterday.. On qvc channel they had a laptop on,,yet without switching it on at all you pressed a button on the side and it lit up if you are in a wi-fi hotspot..So instead of booting up the whole laptop and finding that you cannot get a wi-fi signal just that simple switch idea can help the end user wasted time and battery.You stated about the orange aeroplane flying onto screen to show airplane mode just a litle simple extra effort makes things so much easier even tho its not the biggest invention ever
Time magazine named Iphone invention of the yuear, NOT the N95:





Stop. I mean, don't stop reading this, but stop thinking what you're about to think. Or, O.K., I'll think it for you:

The thing is hard to type on. It's too slow. It's too big. It doesn't have instant messaging. It's too expensive. (Or, no, wait, it's too cheap!) It doesn't support my work e-mail. It's locked to AT&T. Steve Jobs secretly hates puppies. Andï¿½all together nowï¿½we're sick of hearing about it! Yes, there's been a lot of hype written about the iPhone, and a lot of guff too. So much so that it seems weird to add more, after Danny Fanboy and Bobby McBlogger have had their day. But when that day is over, Apple's iPhone is still the best thing invented this year. Why? Five reasons:

1. The iPhone is pretty

Most high-tech companies don't take design seriously. They treat it as an afterthought. Window-dressing. But one of Jobs' basic insights about technology is that good design is actually as important as good technology. All the cool features in the world won't do you any good unless you can figure out how to use said features, and feel smart and attractive while doing it.

An example: look at what happens when you put the iPhone into "airplane" mode (i.e., no cell service, WiFi, etc.). A tiny little orange airplane zooms into the menu bar! Cute, you might say. But cute little touches like that are part of what makes the iPhone usable in a world of useless gadgets. It speaks your language. In the world of technology, surface really is depth.

2. It's touchy-feely

apple didn't invent the touchscreen. Apple didn't even reinvent it (Apple probably acquired its much hyped multitouch technology when it snapped up a company called Fingerworks in 2005). But Apple knew what to do with it. Apple's engineers used the touchscreen to innovate past the graphical user interface (which Apple helped pioneer with the Macintosh in the 1980s) to create a whole new kind of interface, a tactile one that gives users the illusion of actually physically manipulating data with their handsï¿½flipping through album covers, clicking links, stretching and shrinking photographs with their fingers.

This is, as engineers say, nontrivial. It's part of a new way of relating to computers. Look at the success of the Nintendo Wii. Look at Microsoft's new Surface Computing division. Look at how Apple has propagated its touchscreen interface to the iPod line with the iPod Touch. Can it be long before we get an iMac Touch? A TouchBook? Touching is the new seeing.

3. It will make other phones better

jobs didn't write the code inside the iPhone. These days he doesn't dirty his fingers with 1's and 0's, if he ever really did. But he did negotiate the deal with AT&T to carry the iPhone. That's important: one reason so many cell phones are lame is that cell-phone-service providers hobble developers with lame rules about what they can and can't do. AT&T gave Apple unprecedented freedom to build the iPhone to its own specifications. Now other phone makers are jealous. They're demanding the same freedoms. That means better, more innovative phones for all.

4. It's not a phone, it's a platform

when apple made the iphone, it didn't throw together some cheap-o bare-bones firmware. It took OS X, its full-featured desktop operating system, and somehow squished it down to fit inside the iPhone's elegant glass-and-stainless-steel case. That makes the iPhone more than just a gadget. It's a genuine handheld, walk-around computer, the first device that really deserves the name. One of the big trends of 2007 was the idea that computing doesn't belong just in cyberspace, it needs to happen here, in the real world, where actual stuff happens. The iPhone gets applications like Google Maps out onto the street, where we really need them.

And this is just the beginning. Platforms are for building on. Last month, after a lot of throat-clearing, Apple decided to open up the iPhone, so that youï¿½meaning people other than Apple employeesï¿½will be able to develop software for it too. Ever notice all that black blank space on the iPhone's desktop? It's about to fill up with lots of tiny, pretty, useful icons.

5. It is but the ghost of iPhones yet to come

the iphone has sold enough unitsï¿½more than 1.4 million at press timeï¿½that it'll be around for a while, and with all that room to develop and its infinitely updatable, all-software interface, the iPhone is built to evolve. Look at the iPod of six years ago. That monochrome interface! That clunky touchwheel! It looks like something a caveman whittled from a piece of flint using another piece of flint. Now imagine something that's going to make the iPhone look that primitive. You'll have one in a few years. It'll be very cool. And it'll be even cheaper.



its just a pda fone...id rather get an entertainment fone and pda than the iphone...
So if the N95 can be had for free and is such a great phone there should be lines of people going for it, but it is not the case, admit that Apple has introduced a new HIGHLY successful product and people are willing to pay  for it top ï¿½ $ ï¿½  like it or not this is the hard evidence.

By the way I am european, slim and the five Iphones I  am bringing back for my european countryman.I really like this phone - it's so cool!  Apple always manages to be innovative in everything that they do.  I can't wait to have this phone available in South Africa - I'll be the first few to get it.
No, it will not. Do not restore or update the software. If itunes is set to automatically update the software, disable the function (settings).



using hsdpa on voda is well odd,it can try to open up two connections sometimes 3g then 3g+ and you cannot call or recieve txt whilst in hsdpa..When i had n95 it come with a warning that in hsdpa mode it is not possible to make calls so hsdpa is really good???? (not),, and its speed varys violently here in cheshire if you get it to connect just on hsdpa
to myqp



As i said before in my previous post , using 3g on t-mobile uk on an n95 severely disrupts calls and data. Only when i switched to gsm was calls and data stable. Wether this is relevant? As iphone not on t-mobile uk
Hi brynn, you can always just turn off the 3G radio on your 3G phone, it will then fall back to 2G and then the battery life will increase.



In fact if what Jobs had said were true, rather than him just trying to get people to buy a phone without decent technology, he would have had the iPhone use 2G for voice and only use 3G for data. No reason to leave it out.



The O2 network is OK for 3G (never had a problem with it) but itï¿½s not as fast as the others i.e. no HSDPA as far as I know but their 3G network has much more coverage then their EDGE network will (have they actually enabled it yet? Is anyone getting true EDGE speeds or are they just getting GPRS speeds but with an E on the phone?).



You are certainly right about it being a fashion phone and for those that want it for that purpose it is certainly worth the money. Iï¿½m looking at it more from the functionality point of view (with an eye on styling) and Iï¿½m thinking that most people would be better off getting an iPod Touch for ï¿½199 and getting a decent phone and the contract of their choice.

ive been reading thru comments and altho only had 2 minutes with i-phone i have a point for not against steve jobs,,hes damn right about 3g it does eat battery and is unreliable even if you have full strength signal so why not leave it out,,plus o2 3g is the least covered with 3g,,perhaps why steve choose o2 maybe..There is also the fact thats its a fashion fone and most people may buy it for that reason and they most probably only talk and text which is fine,,and watever fashion fone you do buy its likely to have bad camera i.e. nokia luna,,moto v3/v3i or the serene by samsung/b&o so despite the price this fits the fashion categorys general specification to a tee
hey dudes i dont think that its very expensive!!If you have relatives in the us send the iphone to them and they'll send it to you,after that you just have to unlock it and have fun!!its just 399 dollars.here in cyprus the iphone is 399 pounds.thats like double the price of a iphone in the us
Does anyone know if the iphone is compatible with air tunes?
toooooooooooooooooooooo expnsiv 4 sumat lik dat
I had my first look at the phone today.

It looks nice but I donï¿½t think the functions is that good to compete with any of the top phone companies. I donï¿½t think ill be getting one anytime soon.

Plus itï¿½s too expensive for what it is will stick to my N95
At the end of your contract your NOT stuck to O2! the phone comes with a sim inside it and you can transfer your number to and from it! The IPHONE has already been breached in America the same will happen here! At the end of the day if you dont have the IPHONE what gives you the right to comment and give it bad publicity?? This phone is aimed at a certain market as is every phone! It will still be a big seller! At the end of your contract you can get your contract cancelled and use the phone as a pay as you go, like all contracts!
To \[Brightonmijet]/



That is a very, very interesting point which I don't think anyone has actually raised before or even considered.



Thing is, all iPods only last a maximum of 18 months before breaking anyway. The iPhone uses the same battery and is basically an Ipod.



So I don't think this will actually be an issue. By the time your minimum 18 month contract is over, your iPhone should have broken by that time anyway, so I wouldn't worry about it.



On a more serious note, once your contract does expire, it looks like you will have to stick with O2. Remember you cannot remove the built in sim card, and even if you do, you need to unlock, unjack the phone, etc. So you may as well have just done this 18 months BEFORE your contract expires.



So as we can see, there really is NO point buying an iPhone on O2 - your best bet is to buy one and unlock it and then go with an operator who isn't ripping you off for 18 months.



I think O2 know - but have NOT told anyone - that as soon as their contract expires, IF they do not want to continue it, their iPhone will revert back to just being an iPod. And it's pretty disgusting to have spent near ï¿½1000 on an iPod which will be battered after 18 months of use and clearly will be nowhere near that value, especially if you could have just gone out and bought an ipod for ï¿½270...
After playing with one in an 02 store my first impression was, wow this looks good (Like all Mac products) but after enquiring about one not only are we paying more than the americans but 02 only give you a handset for the ï¿½269 then you have to pay ï¿½35 a month for 18 months minimum contract. Makes a total of ï¿½899 at least at the end of contract.



Speaking of end of contract what happens if you reach the end of your contract but do not wish to continue, are you left with a phone you cannot use?
Nice phone, big flop on the opening day's sales! Its good the way people on here can comment on a phone they don't have! If you get the IPHONE once you activate it, thats it. Its yours!! If you fail credit you have 7 days to return it! IPOD was and still is the biggest selling technolagy device EVER made, this IPHONE is an IPOD which has a phone on it! NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND!
for the person who said u can return the phone within 14 days, this is WRONG. It can only be returned under the circumstances where a credit check on o2 has been failed. So think again before you waste peoples time!!!
will it blend [dot] com !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



yes it does !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you record videos on this phone?
jessica you don't know anything about phones the iphone does not rock it's the biggest waste of time since womens rights. If I need an opinion on cooking or cleaning ill ask you.
this phone rocks meng =]
people please read The Main Disatvantages of this phone on this site and tell me is it really so much better than ordinary phone. it practically doesnt have any function...except the highsky priceIphones the best, beta than the rest.
N95s are the most over-rated mobiles on here! Never buy one! Colossal waste of money if you ask a smart person. iPhone=way better and that's that.
Maybe you can't afford the Iphone. I feel sorry for you.
YEAH!! N95s suck! They don't work very well and crash all the time! Get with the program you cavemen! Why can't you just keep up with technology!? iPhones are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better!!!!
Ok, first things first, Apples are way better than PCs, PCS crash all the time and apples don't. Just because the games are mostly made for pc doesn't mean that PCs are better. Seeing as Apple's computers never crash and have a great, sleek format, then OBVIOUSLY they would have damn good phones too. Just because you're jealous of all the other people that have iPhones doesn't mean you should diss them because you can't afford it! Prices come down eventually!
and there is no card slot. sooo apple... wonder if they will launched iPhone 10GB, 20Gb, 30GB in the future?
N95 is so good but no phone company in the world is paying a cent for traffic generated on N95, how come that a growing number of phone companies is paying Apple for traffic generated on Iphones ?

Maybe because they understand the power of this mobile internet

integration tool and the benefits it will bring to them and their

users !
Just got 5 Iphones in the US brought them back to Europe, unlocked them for free on the web, work very well here in Switzerland, seen many people on planes with Iphones, did not see any with N95, what you see are lots of cheap little Nokia phones Iphone is the future of internet integration, and narrow minded people do not understand that, remember the days of basic computers starting c :

Apple gave us the icons on computers and now real mobile internet with its own OSX full power software, who cares bout 5 MP camera and other specs when you have the BEST mobile interface !

Caveman !



bla bla bla but no N95 on Time print your own magazine and see how many copies you sell, success is measured on the marketplace

and Iphone is success !
do you even know about the n95. n95 is superior to this thing no matter what time say's. just look at the spec's buddy of the n95, they speak for themselve's. go look at forbe's magazine nokia giant 1 billion customer's can anyone catch them. n95 navigation, i phone no navigation, n95 5meg iphone 2 meg. i phone no voice dialing, 150 dollar's to get it unlocked, no bluetooth transfer ,no 3g, no applying song's as ringtone's unless you pay pay pay, no flash for camera, no auto focus, no video recording ,send phone in to get battery replaced, no software update thru i tune's unless you want your phone relocked, no sms forwarding, music player not loud enough. if they ever bring some of these vital thing's into a 2nd version of the i phone you will want that 2nd version, then you will have bought 2 i phone's. i have it in one phone n95, plus someone also know's how to put touch screen on the n95 i saw it on the net. n95 win's. apple want's to give you less feature's than n95 so they can sucker you into buying a updated version of the i phone.
Time magazine posts the Iphone as one of the inventions of the year, NOT the N95, sorry guys, Iphone wins, read this week's Time and you will understand, no good to write negative things about the Iphone if you do not have it or simply because you hate Apple and you do not even know why ! Iphone is a new mobile platform that will help internet integration, not simply a cellphone.
to all the iphone purchasers: u guys are all being fooled by the apple company, its like u guys are becoming the lab mouses who are being tested for some weird tests done by the scientists, in this case, the Apple company who created the iPhone, but as a first time user, it's true that u guys spent too much $$ on a rather very low featured phone. first of all, the iphone doesn't support 3G service, this is totally wrong, because right now, all the hitech phones should come with the 3G technology, if u take a look at nokia's N95, or Sony Ericsson's K850, these phones all got the 3G service. secondly,  the iphone doesnt have a better quality camera, it only has 2MP, while N95 n SE K850i have 5MP,clearly, iphone is again totally out for this round. fortunately, iphone has a built in web browser called "safari", this is a way better and user friendly browser than N95 and K850's HTML(netFront) browser. in this round, iphone wins. then, there comes the wifi competition. after trying out the wifi on both the iphone and n95, all i can say is n95's 3G networks works much better and faster than iphone's internet network(iphone only has EDGE service, it's way too slow), so iphone loses in this round. when it's about the phone's input simplicity, iphone wins easily. iphone got the on screen touch screen keyboard for easy text input, while n95 and K850 has to use the t9 to input words slowly, so iphone's text input interface is definitely a great invention, it has set a very good model for the future generation of iphones to follow. finally, let's compare the sound/music. after hearing the music from both the iphone and the n95/k850, i found out the n95 has the best sound quality overall, iphone is not comparable for sound so far, the apple company needs to work on for the later models they will release later in 2008 and  2010. anyway, that's my review for now. i will wait to see if apple company's iPhone 2 will have any significant improvements or not, take care, peace out!!! :D
I agree with the original post, but not completely. The iPhones which are being brought in India by what-so-ever means work absolutely fine initially. You will find the contacts, GPRS, music, etc everything working absolutely fine across all networks in Delhi (as for my knowledge); The only problem is and is definitely going to arise is that the first time you face a problem in the phone or it generally slows down or hangs and all - ideally you would connect it to your PC and go to the Apple website to download the latest firmware. THIS is where money becomes dust and the iPhone will become an 'iBrick'.

Conclusion: You can use the phone as of now but eventually you WILL have to update or upgrade the software sometime. Once connected to the Internet, Apple's server will note that you are sitting in India with an unauthorised piece and wallah! you behold a shiny brick in your hand.
how to delete songs from my iphone?
hello all, I have had a nokia n95 for about 6 months, I brought the iPhone on the day of release in the uk. I will never go back to my n95 its just so messy compared to the iPhone. I think it is clear from all the reveiws I have read that the only people who attack the iPhone are people who have never used one, or who just can't afford one. The main feature that stands out is the keyboard it works so well, very intelligent. Its so much more of a pleasure to use than any other phone. If you are on the edge take the plunge and you will never go back. Enjoy
Just like it did in America, This phone will lose touch very quickly. Ya don't need a fancy phone with touchscreen and a 3.5" display. Phones are used to call people, not for entertainment purposes. If this phone were Cheaper then it would be ok, But at ï¿½269

on an 18 month contract (ï¿½35 min) i wouldn't buy it if i were Bill Gates.



By the way, Nokia's on thier way to creating the ultimate iPhone killer. Watch out apple!
hey dudes who told you that the iphone's battery will only last for 18 months??

have you had it for 18 months and saw that it died??

ipod touch is way better. just get a 3g phone instead that is with all the stuffs of course that were lacking to the features from this crapped iphone. it's just for fashion, nothing's special.
tried the iphone and wasn't impressed the camera is a joke and no 3G..cant play games or record video. How is it so expensive? i've bought an LG Viewty and its 100 times better so don't waste an extra ï¿½100 on an iphone get the viewty.
i am just eager to purchase iphoneterrible,



bluetooth not compatible with file transfer and does not work in my car on the bluetouch system or with my apple i pod connector--i'm sending it back to 02.

Inside reports say a major software update is due within 6 weeks--DO NOT BUY ONE
se 23. you only listen to people that have the i phone you say but you are listening to me and responding back and i don't even have the i phone. go ahead and respond back.
Folks, iPhone is an 'object of desire'. Our likes & dislikes should vary as we are different individuals.



I bought the phone for the desire of owning a piece of history. I do have teething problems with the phone and I was prepared for the same as it is one of it's kind !!



I was not a strong believer of the phone either, but the phone is a charm ! Owners delight for the sense of 'touch'.



Yes, it lacks features that you want, so I guess buy something else ! iPhone is for a market segment (I believe Steve did his job good) as defined by Apple and they have done well.
Alkali,

thanks but they r charging, i want free downloads for my iphone. pls help me

ha ha ha very funny mate. I only come on here to post my knowledge about iphone because i have one, thats y i only listen to people that have it, not some random turkeys. And i dont want latest update from itunes untill they put somtthing good in it. My phone is fully customized from icons, tones, alerts, games keyboard everything and update would me have to load up all over again. 1.0.2 works fine for me
this phone is so overated!!!!! if you buy it you are making a big mistake!! the camera is only 2 megapixels and it dozent even hav a flash, OR MMS!!! which is like sending photos to people. so if ur thinking about buying it, DONT, buy the sony ericsson w810i!!! i have it and i think its mad.

good on ya 4 reedin this
hey se 23. if you want a better experience out of your i phone then download the latest software from i tune's for your i phone. there i tried to help you.
is not a excelent phone because you canot use the bluetooth to excange music photo music(just connect a car device) with other phone,donot have usb masstorage,canot put avi,divx,mpg4,3gp movies and has a crappy camera,a cappy loud speaker (6233 cost only 160e and has a stereo speaker 4 better thean iphone)and cost too much 500e (in Romania)--THE only good part of this phone is the 3,5inch screen--N95 8gb vesrion is better and cost 550e (in Romania)
if you want a good camera buy a Nikon or a Canon if you want the best internet phone mobile platform get the Iphone, if you want to go crazy with settings and software get the N95
bhanu

THE most overrated phone of all time. Doesn't have 3G and can't send an mms and it only has a 2 Megapixel camera. Rubbish.
Bardi. i would definetly buy the n95. this has way more option's than the i phone. gps, louder mp3, bluetooth transfer, 5 meg camera, auto focus, flash ,applying song's as ringtone's without having to pay for them, don't be apple's prisoner. you don't have to pay 150 dollar's to get n95 unlocked it is already unlocked.I just got 5 Iphones and now have 5 useless Nokia sitting in a drawer

will have to pay for proper disposal ...
The success of the Iphone is out of the question, the market thinks different than your irrelevant envious opinion
the differance between a broken i phone on the road and a broken N95 on the road. Skid mark's in front of the N95!!
Iphone " has nothing " but gets paid millions of dollars in revenue sharing on the traffic it generates with the various carriers N95 that " has everything including the kitchen sink " gets NOTHING !!





one of the best phones i have used.

except for bluetooth and camera but other all things are good.
Overpriced, overated and under speced. There are better phones for the money. There are better phones that are cheaper. It looks like Apple didn't know if bring out a phone with a MP3, or a MP3 with abuilt in phone.
This phone winds me up. Why is it receiving such great publicity?



and its not a smartphone or computer!



Lets gets this straight.



"People can't accept the Iphone is better because they can't afford one" - what a loada bollocks



"people cant accept the iphone is better because they don't have one" - also bollocks



I am an N95 owner (wheeey)



for a phone your going to end up spending over ï¿½1000 you expect some high end features.



No 3G? well its hardly a computer then is it. Wheres the point in having a music phone if you cannot download on the go? Also internet browsing speeds are painful. Edge is rubbish!



The browser is hardly revolutionary. It doesnt support flash or javascript...amazing.



Bluetooth. Basic function for a phone, yes it has it but only for a headset. It doesnt support stereo headsets incidently (good music phone!)



Camera is poor. No settings? tbh, why bother putting a camera on the dam thing. you cant send the photos you take anyway (no MMS...first introduced in...2000?)



No radio?? (good music phone!) it cant stream internet radio either (no 3G)



The keyboard. Well thats a joke, i find it impossible to type on.





so there you have it. ï¿½1000+ and you have a phone not even comparable to the nokia 6230.



n95...3g+hsdpa...lala...5mp camera....vga video...stereo bluetooth...gps...proper operating system you can use....



you're all stupid for buying the iphone.
well if you saying a phone is a phone then an iphone would just be like any other touch screen phone right? so dont go around saying a phone is a phone and not a computer otherweise u wouldnt even have bought a iphone if you can just use a damn regular phone with no camera bluetooth or anythign liek that
iphone Is a great phone but mine just won't scroll down the main screen. What can I do??I unlocked it and it works also I put on installer app .i installed many applications but I wanted to unistall some but the installer icon went down and I can't unistall applications.plsplsplsplzpls help!!!!!!and plssssssss answer!!!!!!!!
What`s with the speaker quality for music??? mine kind of sucks...
I have no doubt that all the BIG phone manufacturing companies will

come up with fantastic phones as good as the Iphone or much better as soon as they will be able to feature OSX in their phones !!!!!!!!!!
this phone is the most beautiful mobile.i don't have yet but i must have .also apple make the best mobiles
is there any difference between firmware software : 1.0.2 or 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 and all of them works at any iphone ??

hi!!!the iPhone is awsome cz I'm writing this from it!!
Tell me which manufacturer came up with such a superb phone as its first phone; Undoubtly it is the best phone available.
The i phone ermmmm..........

its alreet a great interface the only thing id say is only having i tunes is pretty rubish and i feel putting a 2 megapixel camera on is abit ermmm well disapointing i would say however watch for its rival the veiwty its a truely wicked phone i must say!

best compomise: buy an itouch instead of an iphone, keep your regular phone to keep up with bluetooth, mms, etc. itouch has all the features of the iphone, except for the phone feature. whadyathink?
hei ishael perhaps some people love 3G or,  simple, they don't like it. Me for example.
No other phones can compare to an Iphone. Apple made all other phones obsolete. Stop complaining about the camera, bluetooth and etc. iPhone is a phone and a computer and that's the most important thing.
I love it!!!!  Sure no bluetooth, games, high megapixel, at least have a camera!!!  Its awesomeAnd the next is going to be that Apple will turn you in as a terrorist

and the CIA will hold you in Guantanamo for five years without trial....
Here is some press info about Iphone Ipod " illegal " music downloading :

One of the most attractive things about the iPod is its capacity to hold thousands of songs. That in itself isn't a bad thing. But what the media and Apple won't publicly acknowledge is that with this remarkable song capacity and the accompanying ease of transfer from all sorts of sources, iPod owners aren't just filling their iPods with songs from the online iTunes service or from their own CD collection. Truth is, many of the songs acquired for iPods ï¿½ in fact, the majority of those songs in many cases ï¿½ are done so without permission. Yep, the iPod is the illegal downloaders' new best friend, and Apple knows it.

So stop complaining, Apple does not force you to buy only songs from Itunes, you CAN do all of the ILLEGAL downloading you want !



according to gsm arena apple is probably taking personal information from any i phone. To people that have bought the i phone it serve's you right!
nj3. idon't believe that for a minute. if apple make's you pay for your music thru i tune's i'am sure it's not that easy to get it free thru a simple web site or download!!
fantastic
Come ON! pliz somebody say something about the speaker quality? is mine broken or it sounds a little distorted?
There is a nice  free software for internet radio on the Iphone with Installer....

Navigate to

http://jailbreakme.com
using Safari on your iPhone or iPod touch and read the instructions there.

No need to pay to get it unlocked, you can upload all the music you want WITHOUT paying Apple a cent, there is a free software called installer that enables your Iphone to add all sorts of features right from the Iphone, no need for a computer because the Iphone IS A COMPUTER with OSX inside and not a crappy PC , when the N95 will have  OSX inside could become an interesting phone, but with poor design.

Watch for soon to be released software to shoot videos and upload them to Youtube, why do you think they have an agreement with Youtube ?

One step at the time, Apple knows how to do proper marketing ad positioning to make customers happy and stay in business as a strong company with money to do R&D for new leading edge products.
Agree with below
if i can afford the n95 then i can afford the iphone, but i'am not going to be apple's prisoner and pay for my music and pay to get iphone unlocked. No bluetooth transfer, no video record, no gps, no flash, no fm radio, no voice dialing, no 3g.
LOL @ jerry



jerry says buy the lg viewty!!!! are you crazy. last lg I brought was the shine and it fell apart after 2 weeks. your surname wouldent happen to be Springer, would it?
bloo wolf has a point.. itouch is the same as the iphone without the phone features.. besides if you dont pass the credit check you have to return it anyway..
Coud anyone tell me how is the built in speaker quality?? cuz mine sounds distorted with bass
i love this phone and this phone is better than N95
look friend this phone does not have video option & bluetooth is only for headset support !!! u cannt send or receive files via bluetooth in this fone...is there any fool how would buy a 8gb phone that cannt do video & bluetooth that cannt send or receive files which r very common function even at the cheper price fones.
The iphone is the best h/set i've ever had and yes I do own a n95, i can watch my youtube and have a laugh,  the content on the phone is rich and the sound quality is the best around.



Lots of jealous people on here who try to put the h/set down but guess what,  they dont have the iphone because it's too expensive for them and you can generally guess what sort of person people are by the way they talk about the iphone in a negative way for example someone saying the phone is crap!!! something a chav would say and I don't have time for people like that.



Iphone is for those who can afford it and want to experience something totally new and amazing.



Go into a o2 store or a apple atore and find out for yourself guys and you will see how amazing the iphone is.



Email client has to be the best i've seen on any mobile too



its so crap frez up all the time. get the viewity so much better!
Hi there by the way i am not: bashing - deliberately and repeatedly bashing the same brand will get you banned    or

trolling - deliberately antagonizing other brand/model users will get you banned.



But everyone knows this phone is the worst phone ever made and it sucks, i do feel sorry for anyone who has it, sorry mate
People seem to not realise how big apple is, apple have the best computers for media and designing, best music players out there ipod and the best web besed phone the iphone and then u get guys talking about there n95,  does the battery last for about 1 hour in the n95?



Iphone is here and it's here to stay we have had mostly positive feedback on the iphone

guyz, this is just an ipod with phone function. i rather get a nano video and nokia n82. yup separate device but they do what they do best....satisfy me! yeah!
I dont see what the fuss is about. Looks to me like a PDA with less features. Apple need to do better than that
More on the fanatics issue :

Apple has been seeing record Mac sales for quite some time now and as expected, the companyï¿½s platform has been slowly but steadily gaining market share. While the Cupertino company may only have a  tiny fraction of the entire worldwide market at the moment, its growth is unparalleled.



iPods, iPhones, the ï¿½Get a Macï¿½ campaign and even the latest Mac models themselves have all generated so much buzz that Appleï¿½s mindshare has grown dramatically over the past year. Not surprisingly, this buzz as well as the halo effect have had a major impact in attracting new business to Apple.

Research firm Net Applications reports that Appleï¿½s global share of the personal computer market had grown to 6.6 percent in September. Considering that during the same month last year Apple had 4.7 percent, the year-over-year gain is over 40 percent. Even on a short term, Appleï¿½s market share grew from 6.15 percent in the previous month, which would amount to a sequential gain of over 7 percent.

The growth that Apple is seeing is simply amazing, especially when taking into account the fact that Leopard is due to be released at the end of the month and many users are postponing their purchases in order to get the latest version of the operating system with their new machines.



All that market share had to come from somewhere and it is not surprising to see that Microsoft saw a decline of 3 market share points from the same month a year ago. Apple has been reporting that over half of their Mac sales are to people new to the platform, and the market share results are starting to reflect that in a big way.

The company is expected to continue to do very well in the current quarter, due both to back-to-school sales and the recently released iMac models. Some analysts are predicting that Mac sales will exceed Wall Street expectations by as much as 400,000 units, for a total of 2.35 million iMacs and MacBooks.



Apple Inc.'s share of the U.S. personal computer market for the third calendar quarter of 2007 was 8.1 percent, up from 6.2 percent during the same period one year ago, according to preliminary results released from Gartner on Wednesday.



The Cupertino-based company's U.S. Mac shipments grew 37.2 percent year-over-year -- more than twice as fast as any other manufacturer ranked in Gartner's top 5 PC vendors for the three-month period ending September -- helping it snag a spot as the No. 3 U.S. PC vendor overall.



no one needs a feature that the iphone has not..that's the point.....of a fanatic! =)hehehe
Iphone Iphony

If you are unable to get all of the software available online to make Iphone the greatest portable internet device ever do not post your

inabilities on this blog, It is evident you have never used an Iphone

the does are A LOT MORE than the does not, sure it does not have a kitchen sink included, but it enables you to have internet in your pocket with a fantastic user interface that only OSX can give.
in our city 3G has free 30MB each month.

anyway iphone must have 3G support.
to Simon



What fw do you have? If its 1.1.1 or later you should be fine. I'm still using 1.0.2 and I had that problem until I dl 2 modded files from modmyifone.com now my iPhone is good with sound quality
iPhone, iphony.. just too much hype!



Cons:

1. AT&T only contracts (unless you jailbreak your phone and hacked with anysims)

2. No search function on Contact (just a simple search program!)

3. No additional software possible without hacking your phone.

4. Bluetooth only to headset.

5. Cannot connect to any GPS device. Google Map? Good looking  but next to useless when you need direction.

6. What the point of having a nice screen if you can't:

6.1. Play popular format download video (avi, mpg, dat, mp4 etc etc). You will have to find converters to Iphone format and it does not always works.

6.2. Take video

6.3. Read common documents like PDF or even text or words.

6.4 any other things you can think of that does not have it in the standard programs.













If it doesent have 3G its NOT worth it...

Video calling is the future!
i bought and apple iphone two days after it was released, and ive had many, many phones over the years, from samsung, nokia, motorola and lg, and the iphone is by far the best phone ive ever had, it may not have video, or 3g, theterface is the best ive ever used and apple's customer serivce is the nest ive ever exp. i dropped my phone and broke the screen and it was completely ruined to no ones fault but my own, and walked into an apple store and they gave me a brand new one, no questions asked, 3g is not needed with the wifi connection, and the egde, it will work fine for most peoples applications, if you cant get what you need on a wi fi connection or edge you have problems, andprobably should get a life and get off your phone. the phone is awesome. wellllll worth the money. and would recommend it to anyone. i have also "jailbreak"-ed my phone, and adds even more awesome features, get one, you wont be dissapointed
People don't realize it. I have both Prada Phone and iPhone and I can compare them. People shouldn't compare iPhone and Prada phone anyways because you're basically comparing a Smart Phone with a CELL Phone. First of all on Looks Prada takes the cake no other way as a phone iPhone would be too big but it's features, not talking about the camera, video calling or 3G bullshit it's about innovation. Apple changes the way we look at cellphones and how a smart phone should really be smart! IPhone isn't for people who wants a phone but it's more for people who need it like businessmen etc. Yes the phone is great and it's probably one of the most user friendly phone ever but if you want head-turning looks without caring much for the interface but making everyone jealous? Get Prada phone but if you want a phone thats worth every penny you pay for get an iPhone because before you get one you won't realize how marvel of a machine Apple has made.

a chav would have this phone am i wrong??

i wood have to say the only thing i liked about it was the camera which is brilliant for a 2MP camera



but everything else i h8
as good as it gets in a tiny speaker.....
How is the built in loudspeaker quality?
wait till they will have OSX inside  ..........never had any problem's with my n95. stop telling lies about the n95 nj3.
nj3. do not have battery issue's with my n95. use gps abit during the day , mp3, call's, still full bar's.
It could be a software like a screen saver that uses power all the time...
I am not sure whether my phone is falty but the stand by and talk time are NO MORE THAN 24hours stand by and 3 hours talk time which is rubbish.
More on Wi Max, knowing is being able to understand where the future is and why companies make apparently "Stupid" decisions

WiMAX is a wireless digital communications system, also known as IEEE 802.16, that is intended for wireless "metropolitan area networks".   WiMAX can provide broadband wireless access (BWA) up to 30 miles (50 km) for fixed stations, and 3 - 10 miles (5 - 15 km) for mobile stations.  In contrast, the WiFi/802.11 wireless local area network standard is limited in most cases to only 100 - 300 feet (30 - 100m).



With WiMAX, WiFi-like data rates are easily supported, but the issue of interference is lessened.   WiMAX operates on both licensed and non-licensed frequencies, providing a regulated environment and viable economic model for wireless carriers.



WiMAX can be used for wireless networking in much the same way as the more common WiFi protocol.  WiMAX is a second-generation protocol that allows for more efficient bandwidth use, interference avoidance, and is intended to allow higher data rates over longer distances.



The IEEE 802.16 standard defines the technical features of the communications protocol.  The WiMAX Forum offers a means of testing manufacturer's equipment for compatibility, as well as an industry group dedicated to fostering the development and commercialization of the technology.



WiMax.com provides a focal point for consumers, service providers, manufacturers, analysts, and researchers who are interested in WiMAX technology, services, and products.  Soon, WiMAX will be a very well recognized term to describe wireless Internet access throughout the world.



WiMAX, the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, is a telecommunications technology aimed at providing wireless data over long distances in a variety of ways, from point-to-point links to full mobile cellular type access. It is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard, which is also called WirelessMAN. WiMAX allows a user, for example, to browse the Internet on a laptop computer without physically connecting the laptop to a router, hub or switch via an Ethernet cable. The name WiMAX was created by the WiMAX Forum, which was formed in June 2001 to promote conformance and interoperability of the standard. The forum describes WiMAX as "a standards-based technology enabling the delivery of last mile wireless broadband access as an alternative to cable and DSL."
3G for Iphone:

Emailing works well on edge, 3G would mean a lot of battery power being used, I noticed after several weeks of practical use that the easy way you connect on open WI FI networks at home office school or public places do not make you feel you are missing something in terms of browsing. When you are out driving do you really want to browse the internet ? To do that you need to sit in a comfortable place and focus on the web.

I think the compromise is good and I believe that in the Apple tradition of implementing leading edge standards it would be best to go straight to WI MAX rather than 3G which is a standard that after all has not really delivered what it promised to begin with.

Video calling is NOT widely used and it slows down a lot when the cells are crowded with users.
This demonstrates that the N95 is a phone with a lot of features, but kind of  over engineered, the good thing about the Iphone which I like more and more as I use it for several weeks now is the compromise of good performance and ease of use. Sure it could have a few more thigns, but  practical terms it delivers a very good phone service, email, and internet browsing with the excellent user interface of OSX, and with the upcoming software update many of the missing things could very well become a reality, like full bluetooth file transfer and video camera.
N95 very good phone :



Nokia N95

Support Forum

Welcome to our forums. Please sign-in or register.

More N95 Problems !! Fedup now :-(

Hi everyone



im now on my 3rd Nokia N95 from the 02 network

(as you probably all know from my previous postings)

the first 2 handsets had high pitch whining noise and awful sliders which were wobbling on the right hand side, appaulling workmanship, i dont even know how they were allowed to leave the Nokia Factory like this!

maybe the workers were all drunk or something?

it isnt only me thats complained of these faults, check all the other forums about the N95!



anyway, my 3rd handset has been working ok

(or so i thought)

everything was working fine, no wobbly slider, no whiny noise..

but about 3 - 4 times per day as of 3 days ago, the phone just restarts itself when it`s just sat there!!!

WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING ?

have i now got to send this CRAP handset back aswell?

i dont want to drive 20 miles to nearest Nokia Service Centre, WHY should i ????

i also left my house this morning at 5.30am to take a friend to the Airport, the phone was unplugged from the Charger with full battery life, i used the N95`s sat nav to get there and back, its now 9.35am and i have 2 bars left on the battery life!!

truly appauling if you ask me



Ufax u worte you can not send songs, pictures, and files from iphone. Can you please tell us can we recieve songs, pictures, and files via BT in iphone   Thanx
I just saw the video of the iPhone and I have to say that... is an amasing phone!!!!!! best interface i've ever seen, the mediaplayer is awesome and the best picture viewer ever. i've always been a Nokia Adict and I'll always be, but we'll have to see next iphone to come with all the features incorporated and all problems fixed, it's going to be a new era, that's for sure. bye.
is their any defference between firmware 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 and 1.1.2 ?



what is it ?
I am not impressed with this phone I think it has been mis sold I think it is poo poo ps can you use this phone if you have no thumbs??
Why are there no buttons on the i phone and can I share music files with other people

Iphone has a built in PDF viewer you simply get your mail tap on the PDF attachment and see it on the screen, you can easily zoom in and see all of the details....
i wanted to ask ..goes the iphone have a 3rd party app. for viewing documents and pdf files

why cant u play games on that phone
The phone is brilliant, battery life is very good, design of the phone is excellent and it the best video player and music player i've ever seen on.



Ok the phone doesn't have 3g but it's got edge and wifi.



Good thing about the iphone is that apple can turn the negatives into positives when the iphone2 comes out



It's apples 1st year in the mobile industry so it's bound to get better.



It's all big competition but it surprises me that people try and compare the iphone with the n95 because the n95.





Sorry i forgot to say it doesnt even have MMS..it cant send picture msgs period!
Seriously i thot the iphone was the next best thing and i wanted to get it badly..so after reviewing it very well it showed me truely that beauty is only skin deep...i went to the apple store to test it out..the interface is the best ive used and trust me i am a seasoned phone user cos ive used every single type and format of phones...apart from a wonderful interface good looks , superb music functionality..how can a phone in this day and age have a camera that doesnt record videos..it does just it ..shoot pictures and nothing else no zoom no editing no nothing..how can a phone that good not be a ble to send files via bluetooth...if i want i cant send songs, documents ,pictures , anything..practically useless..they shouldnt even have put the bluetooth then..the iphone battery is locked up in a case that cant be opened why? so you would always go back to apple to get it repaired if your phone goes bad(stupid)..the phone has no drafts, outbox of any sort..let me see..your typing a msg ,you receive a call..voila your msg has gone up in flames no way to save in the outbox it doesnt have..you cant multiple select contacts to send a msg to(you cant send msgs to more than one person at a time) imagine xmas or thanksgiving then.... i Got a HTC tytn 2 and have never looked back..All in all the iphone is a breakthrough but remember to try one 1st before getting it..again beauty is only skin deep..


http://www.winter-gsm.com/item...catid=9&id=1

note :

pls dont buy this phone , bucuse waist of money & time . lot of feuther inthis phone but one & most bad problem found ( hangeing ) problem minimum 20 time in the day .
i lab this kind of toy, awsome!!!
plastic phone. Is that the best you've got!

For all cry babies, stick with your n95. iPhone beat n95 in every aspect. Plastic phone. Hehehe
Iphone does have gps now... well... not GPS.. but it is a form of global positioning using wifi singals or telephone signals... its not as accurate as gps... but it still works perfectly on my iphone... its called NAVIZON and its software...
Does this phone use the GPS with pay or is it free GPS
And never forget that Steve Jobs gave us the personal computer

He is now giving us a new portable communication platform,

not another cellphone.

I like to make money the legal way and lots of it
yes of  average phones

will wait to see N95 mention someplace as a milestone invention
Nokia doesn't go out of business because they don't rip people off and they do offer a good supply of differant phone's.

look at the nokia e90! Another fantastic phone! Htc is also another good cell phone. Apple is the only company that has such basic bluetooth and that also make's people pay for their music! I have 160 mp3 song's on my phone and i didn't pay a cent for them and can apply any of them as Ringtone's.
because they make millions of average consumer phones

Time Magazine Names iPhone ï¿½Invention of the Yearï¿½
nj3. If the i phone is so great , then why hasn't nokia gone out of business!
useless to talk to to you that cannot face the reality of the SUCCESS of the Iphone
waste of time and money. Over hyped and under delievered. Bluetooth only works with Apple few. I have been trying to get rid of it but no one wants itIt's a lot bigger and bulkier than I thought it would be.  It's very brickish.  It's a great phone and you can get a lot of good applications, but I'm waiting for something better.
i have long finger nails... and it is kind of hard for me to use this phone which is only touchscreen... especially when writing an sms...
It's the best phone that i ever had.

Thank you apple
roger's and fido don't offer the i phone! i thought all cell carrier's are dying to get it. In fact i heard from a roger's employee that they will be offering the n95!
i saw the i phone today, once again and to me it didn't look like it was made from steel. Maybe glass at the front, but i was tapping at the back and it didn't feel like steel. It doesn't say steel in the spec's on gsm arena.
And pay separately for data service.....
From ebay you can get Iphone..If it is used, you will take your iphone and go store to get SIM CARD, but if it is not used and brane new, then sim card already inside the phone, and you have to do all your pc and Itune...That's all....
Do you get also 24    months of  unlimited data service when you buy it on Ebay?
I think the phone is great but i dont want to leave vodafone. what can i do?
vijay,

NO it has none.I have it.
Jimmy,

Is on top of the phone in the middle.There is a small hole in which you can use office pin to pop out!
does anyone know which version of iphone is now at the stores?

is 1.1.1 still available? (US)
@ mFxG



Without Wi-Fi or EDGE the YouTube application won't work. Google Maps will work but it's slow.
for person saying this phoen should of had skype, it cant! they have signed a coontract with 3, in which they state skype will never be on any other mobile unless its 3, aka it couldnt be built with skype, unless 3 bought it, and were the only people selling it in the world, with exception if they made a second i-pod skype phone just for 3... blah blah...
Can anyone tell me what you tube is like when you are on normal internet (Gprs) and what is google maps like

in my opinion excelent for browsing thru internet
se23. If apple give's you some of the thing's the i phone is missing thru software update's as opposed to having to buy another i phone then there is something good to be said about that!
forward sms is here, it just goes to show that this phone can do all the things iphone haters say it cant. sms forward is not a big thing but it's a step for all iphone lovers. cant wait for the sdk in feb. iphone is awesome
nj3. go crying to apple's legal departnent, it's a free world for anyone to write what they feel whether you like it or not. it is obvious that i bother you. what is really dumb is when you said apple's legal department was going to investigate into something i wrote. you have no valid point's against the n95. go on the n95 site and broadcast how great your i phone is if you have any gut's!!
SMSD will work with ATT iphones ? Im trying it, and my iphone screen says SAFARI CANT OPEN THIS FILE

Great guy Amrut Joshi

I got the app and it works very well, waiting for bluetooth now.





Great news to all the iphone users... Finally an application created by Amrut Joshi to forward sms. The wonder application is on the installer v3 . Check the recent packages & install smsd application. Works great. So all the people cribbing lack of the service Stop it now. I am sure forwarding sms to multiple people & forqarding to multiple contacts & offcourse bluetooth transfer does not seem to be far.
You are making a fool of yourself on this blog, I always back my statements with facts, you are simply making stories up because you are gealous of the Iphone success...

Why don't you go on the N95 blogs to tell your great stories.



Umbelliveble....
Positives and negatives. Most of you will know the positives, so a bit of critics:

- Cannot hear much while on the phone

- Loud speaker is also far too quiet

- Restricted bluetooth

- No FM radio

- Photos after dark .. forget it

- Unable to record video

- Tried to take the SIM card out ?

(Go on the net first for instructions ..)



On this link you can see a video done by PC World Magazine about stress scratch and drop and it shows that Iphone is very strong and it DOES NOT scratch or brake even if you drop it while standing up several times on hard surfaces !

stupid phone...it vibrated off my bedside table and fell..its the first time it ever fell..and it becomes completely useless, bottom half of the screen doesn't respond to touch anymore, there goes $500..
Thanks guys,



But isnt it illegal to use Wi Fi since i am using their server? AndI am not paying anything for using Wi Fi. So to use edge i have to connect though my cell network provider? is that correct? I am in australia and most of the wi fi networks are locked..thats bit bizzar isnt it??
new software 20.0.15 make's the n95 even that much better than i phone!
What is EDGE?



Further enhancements to GSM networks are provided by Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology. EDGE provides up to three times the data capacity of GPRS. Using EDGE, operators can handle three times more subscribers than GPRS; triple their data rate per subscriber, or add extra capacity to their voice communications. EDGE uses the same TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) frame structure, logic channel and 200kHz carrier bandwidth as today's GSM networks, which allows it to be overlaid directly onto an existing GSM network. For many existing GSM/GPRS networks, EDGE is a simple software-upgrade.



EDGE allows the delivery of advanced mobile services such as the downloading of video and music clips, full multimedia messaging, high-speed colour Internet access and e-mail on the move.



Due to the very small incremental cost of including EDGE capability in GSM network deployment, virtually all new GSM infrastructure deployments are also EDGE capable and nearly all new mid- to high-level GSM devices also include EDGE radio technology. The Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) states that, as of May 2007, there were 223 commercial GSM/EDGE networks in 113 countries, from a total of 287 mobile network operator commitments in 142 countries (source: www.gsacom.com).


first time i brought the i phone i was so happy i used it for almost 6 or 7 months i never tried to use a nokia or a s.e. even though i had those now im pretty bored with the i phone cuz nothings changed just the same i phone i brought at first ... i play videos i play music thats all i do with it ... i think the last time i called someone is two three weeks ago ... i should have brought something else ... but im too late ... :-(
t Rex , this new firmware in feb will be hacked before the end of the month its released
hey all again,



Just watching this forum over the last few weeks it seems to me that the only people who are bad mouthing the iPhone are people who can't afford it or who are just to slow to understand it. Now I had the OLD "god phone" the n95 for 6 months and then I brought my iPhone. Now unlike the n95 the iPhone doesn't crash all the time. also I don't have to wait for the phone because its so slow like the n95. You iPhone haters can keep your plastic "jack off all trades" n00b sticks and I will enjoy my nice shine iPhone. Ummm I could give my n95 to charity but I don't think they would accept it! But joking a side please just try and open your small minds to what a difference the iPhone is going to make to the industry!
Damn apple phone. You can't get anything from the reviews, because they are likely to be biased, and people only comment if they are obsessed with loving or hating them.



Give me a sendo m550 anyday...
if id doesnt have the features you want,

then go buy some other massive ugly phone.



iphone has great 3rd party support.

nes games, gba games, etch a sketch, ect.
Is it ture that the iPhone is only AT&T ie it cannot have a sim inside it, so that one can switch connections! i mean while having the same phone! please do tell!
TO T-rex , if i already has an unlocked iphone , i can't get the new firmwares at feb. ???



plz answer me ....



There's going to be another big firmware update this febuary which will enable the iphone to send mms messages flashplayer and lots more great features but for those who has unblocked the phone to other networks will be doomed because not only will it brick the phone it will disable everything on the phone,  Looking forward to the new firmware :-)  can't wait



Remember where you heard this from (T-REX)
sup ppl!hmm i just got my iphone about 2 days ago so it have the security 1.1.2 or wich one? ty
right on nick!! i own the n95 as well, good to see you posting here!
i have used one.



The only thing that impressed me was the youtube application which worked very well.



but the phone constantly freezes



the browswer is useless and cant display anything more than pictures and text



the camera im not too bothered about



the music player cant download on the move, it can only do it through wifi because its not worth downloading songs on a 2g network.



Im an N95 owner and its everything, its amazing and id never consider replacing it
My Iphone HAS:

Internet radio

Itunes music store one click download

Stereo Bluetooth Headset

Hi Anas,

I lived 5 years in Jordan, and have one friend called Anas, I worked in TTC for computers,anyway, still i did not buy the iphone, awaiting for the Arabic version, hope within this month I will get it and let you know how you can get the Arabic version.



regardsi can see my phone's navigation just fine, but i don't even have to look at it because it talk's to me with voice guidance. i don't have to spend extra money on a separate navigation system. the idea behind navigation in a cell phone is that you have your phone with you wherever you go. i go with someone else in there car who has no navigation say for example someone who has the i phone we can find our way around, no thank's to the i phone!!
I drive top of the line Benz with excellent GPS navigator,

I buy my BIG toys with the money I make on Apple shares....
CNBC's Jim Goldman reports on rumors from "a very good source of [his] with good connections to Apple's Asian manufacturing partners."



Goldman has heard that Apple will be making headlines in the next weeks-to-months related to the iPod Touch, iPhone and ultra-portable laptop.



- iPod touch is said to have had its manufacturing increased substantially to 5.1 million units for the holiday shopping season.

- 3G iPhone expected to hit store shelves by May or June.

- Finally, the rumored Ultra portable laptop will arrive at Macworld San Francisco 2008.

Apple shares up again today  2.46%



Jack of all trades but master of none..........
You buying phone for Navigation ? and you think you will be easy drive and look your small n95 screen as Navigation ?...This is 2007, and there allot of navigation system with big screen and start from 200.00...The best phone is IPHONE...
nj3. the i phone has no feature's compared to the n95. when you are somewhere especially at night in your car in another city or if you live in a big city and you need navigation but your i phone doesn't have it, are you going to be thinking of all  the i phone's that are "supposedly" selling. oh well i'am lost but the i phone really sell's!!!!
no easier than any other operating system. developers are pretty restricted though. the iphone doesnt support much. For a piece of kit at that price, its trash
You CAN customize your Iphone with installer, you should see what I have on it, I just downloaded with one click a new app today

that acts as an amplifier and gives a much better audio output through the Iphone tiny speakers, this is the beauty of this platform,

EASY and new applications every day, and in February even officially.....
but WHY WHY WHY do you lot think its so good. It doesnt mean you can do anymore or less. It might as well not run on an operating system at all.



I love symbian because its so flexible. You can completely customise your phone and install applications which are not just web based applications.
" Net Applications has issued an interesting report stating that the iPhone has quickly overtaken Microsoft's Windows Mobile as the most used mobile OS on the web "

Symbian has been out for years and .........

no  luck !
Nick, Symbian you say is good but OSX mobile is today number ONE on the planet and in such a short time.....

Could it be that you are wrong and millios of people right ?
this phone is tuch scream i am told .

what is th\t gets sticky ? or wet ?

would this make it freeze or is it durexable ? hard wearing ?

my friend broke his in a day , this is not good bekuz i am much harder than he is all the time ! som1 tell me plz ... and fast
I think the iphone is pretty cool.

Itï¿½s how apple have gone about selling it. I think if they just left it to the networks

It would of done much better its not worth ï¿½270.00 on a 18 month contract when you can get better phones for less

They have pretty much told O2 how to sell it, which I think is wrong.

None of the other phone manufactures do things like this.
It has i-pod audio pip
Whats so good about the operating system?!



You cant install your own applications on the iphone (oh you need to actually HACK it)



and the applications you install need to be free of flash and java.



The operating system is supposedly "secure". From what?! The browser is completely incapable of loading up anything dangerous because it only supports text and photos basically.



its useless.



Symbian, now thats good.
You know its bad when the selling feature is cover flow...
does this phone have an mp3 player ?

if not does it have an fm radio ???

i think an i-pod and phone would be better ???!?!!!???
If it is much better why they do not make exclusive contracts like Apple does ?

Nokia is in business to make money, but to get those lucrative exclusives you need superior products to lure those customers,

sorry
Yu may not adjust the volume through your shirt with the Iphone,

but you can do this :

" Apple could blow away competitors like Nokia and Sony-Ericsson for years to come if they were not tied down to these exclusive deals," said Mike Demmick of the London-based cellphone market research firm Dialed-In.















Despite the mounting evidence, Apple and its carrier partners have been doing everything to fight anything remotely threatening these exclusive deals. These exclusive arrangements represent an extraordinary revenue opportunity for a cellphone maker. To win exclusive sales rights, carriers are paying Apple up to 40%, or more than twice the industry average, of what their customers pay for the devices and their service contracts, according to various estimates from Wall Street analysts.



It appears from various estimates, not from Apple, that should Apple hit its goal of selling 10 million by the end of 2008, the exclusive deals will generate about $2 billion, or 6% of Apple's expected 2008 sales.



AND THAT IS WONDERFUL MUSIC FOR A shareholder. never mind the volume setting on the N95 music



This phone is not not that good and has few functions.



its camera doesn't have auto focus feature and flash. thats sucks.


Two million people and growing like it and the OSX is the largest mobile operating system on the planet.
If you say so, but not nearly as successful as the Iphone,

sorry
THE N95 IS A FAR BETTER MUSIC PLAYER THAN THE IPHONE.



heres why:

-unrecessed 3.5mm jack

-Radio

-Digital radio

-music store you can download from without wifi

-very loud and clear stereo speakers.



the iphone has

-recessed 3.5mm jack

-mono, quiet loudspeaker.

-No radio

-No digital radio (over a 2g network, HA!)

-itunes store only avaliable through Wifi (why don't you use your home computer then??



see!

the iphone falls short!

i got all application in my iphone like sms forwarding,contact earch with name ,lock box and lot of application .....i stay in mumbai if ne one want can contact me at mobail number 9820283832 or email me .....thanxs
iphone is d best for me okiii bcu'z the wifi and youtube music vid is a very good features like n95 5mpix wla nmn gnun kgndang progrm im not satisfied bcu'z last year my phone n95 not good 4 me its boring phone......
if you happened to be without a charger with the i phone and your battery was right down , you can't just pop in a replacement battery, but this would work with the n95.
my understanding is that you have to pay for your music thru i tune's on the i phone. no voice dialing on the i phone, with my bluetooth while driving i don't even have to touch my phone to make a call on my n95. don't forget there is no a2dp with the i phone for stereo bluetooth headphone's.
ok, IM BACK!!! lol. "KING OF PHONES" vs "JESUS PHONE" cont'd.





don't get me wrong, the iPhone's camera is still pretty good esp. if you compare it to let's say, the t-mobile wing(also a 2mp cam). on the wing the pictures that you take INDOORS has a "yellowish" tint but the iPhone's pictures that come out looks more real and "life-like." but when you compare that to the N95-2, well then, there you'll see the difference! pictures that come out of the N95-2 are more CRISP, and CLEAR as expected out of this 5mp, carl-zeiss optics shooter.



and to the guy below me(sorry, im having a hard time with your name), the N95-2 DOES have a nice form factor that's actually one of the MAIN reasons why i bought it was because of its style! the N95-2 has that COOL phone look(dual-slider + black w/ chrome accents) with an "x-factor" appeal whereas the iPhone is just a bar-style which makes it look more elegant and sophisticated at the same time.



GPS: (winner, N95-2)



HANDS-DOWN nokia takes this one!!! built-in GPS with maps PREINSTALLED truly makes this a fine GPS device. the iPhone has a similar application which is called navizon GPS however it is not TRUE or maybe you can even say "fake" GPS as it just works off of interpolating your actual location through cell towers and your wi-fi location. AND, you need wi-fi for this to work.



WEB-BROWSING/INTERNET: (winner, iPhone)



having a LARGE screen definitely helps when your surfing the web and the iPhone has it! viewing webpages on a 3.5in screen is DEFINITELY better than on a 2.8 one. also, the iPhone's web-browsing is made better because you can just "flip" your phone however you like(vertically or horizontally) and your webpages will load in either regular(vertical), or LANDSCAPE(horizontal) mode automatically! you can keep on doing this(positioning the phone either vertically or horizontally) and the webpages will follow the orientation of the phone! the N95-2 has a similar application called the "rotateme" which let's you view your webpages like the iPhone however, its not available for public download yet it's still in "beta" version and you need to have it "signed" meaning you HAVE to register the application first under your own IMEI for it to work and doing that requires a dev key which is really hard to get or, you can have it "signed" for you by someone who has one but thats a whole 'nother story! lol.



YOUTUBE: (winner, iPhone)



i was personally disappointed in the N95-2 when it came to this. you can READ the comments section AS WELL as watch the videos however, THERE IS A LIMIT to the viewable videos you can watch(and its only on the "mobile" version). bummer! if you try to watch other videos NOT in the mobile version it'll give you an error saying your webbrowser does not support javascript or you need to download the newest version of the flash player and it'll just tell you to wait because they're currently converting MOST of the video's into "mobile" format. there IS a way for you to watch whatever videos you want but it involves downloading/installing the opera web browser, a flash player, downloading the video you want to watch through a website, CONVERTING it, and then watching it! compared to the iPhone where you can just "click" on the youtube icon, search for the vid, click it, and watch. now the thing with the iPhone is you can watch ALL of the videos that you want however you CAN'T read the comments posted for that vid in the comments section! but which would you rather prefer? watching the videos or reading the comments?



MUSIC: (winner, iPhone)



having an mp3 player nowadays is a MUST! the N95-2's music player is pretty good but nothing beats having an iPod! also, transferring songs from your pc to the iPhone is alot easier. just drag n' drop files(songs/vids whatever) to your iTunes, sync, and you're all set whereas on the N95-2, you have to search your pc for the files through the nokia music manager(pc suite), wait until it finishes, and THEN upload!



SPEAKERS: (winner, N95-2)



the speakers on this thing is LOUD!!! it's like having a small jukebox with you when this phone's turned up 100%! seriously! and i like the N95 for this one because it has "stereo widening(well, most nokia's have those nowadays)" which could make the sound even louder! sound through the headphones is about the same for both though, and they're both pretty good!



KEYBOARD: (winner, iPhone)



i PERSONALLY, prefer qwerty keyboards(im a sidekick user, rem!?) because i text alot and also it helps when your using your phone as a PDA when you're entering your appointments, to-do's, contacts, emails, etc. the iPhone has a "virtual/on-screen keyboard"(obviously, because it has no buttons, save for the "home" button) and it was frustrating at first because it would suggest words for you and USE THEM instead of the word that you're intending to type but there's a way around that where you just download an application(from your phone) which let's you have more control over how your keyboard behaves.







that's it for now i think im tired and i think i need some sleep. lol. final thoughts to come................
for my need's i have no problem's with the battery on the n95 and i do everything this other guy does with the exception of wi fi on all the time,but my workplace has free wi fi so i don't continually search there and wherever else i'am i might start a search. i listen to music alot and use gps here and there. As for style i'am very happy with how the n95 look's!
hello everyone!



i just want to share my personal opinions about the N95(8gb) and the iPhone(8gb) UNLOCKED. i guess you could call this the "KING OF PHONES" vs the "JESUS PHONE" if you want. lol. i was fortunate enough to be able to use and test these 2 and i'll try to keep this as factual and as unbiased as i can. but first of all, just to let y'all know, i've never been a "fanboy" of NEITHER of these two companies - I'VE NEVER had ANY "apple" products before(the iPhone was my FIRST) and my nokia experience has only been with the N95-2(currently), n6600(my very 1st nokia phone), and the n80ie. i was mainly a "sidekick" fanboy as i've had the sidekick 2(regular/special ed.), 3(reg./spec. ed.), lx, and slide. i've also used other t-mobile phones(which is my carrier, actually) such as the wing, blackberry 8700g, and the 8100 pearl. i've also used other phone's such as s.e.'s: w900(i LOVE this one!), w810, t290a, p990i and htc's: p3600, p4350, and the softbank x01ht(equvalent to the tytn). now that y'all know my cellular background let's get on to the report, shall we!? ^_^



STYLE/FORM FACTOR: (winner, iPhone)



the iPhone is larger and sleeker whereas the n95 is short and stubby. this one comes down to personal preference i guess and i like the iPhone better on this one.



BATTERY LIFE: (winner, iPhone)



at first i didn't believe what i read on the forums but it's true! the n95's battery life is pretty short. i was only playing with the phone for a couple of hours like sending text, surfing the web, NO CALLS, wi-fi constantly on, played around with the GPS, and after FOUR HOURS(from a full charge) my battery life was down to half! on the iphone i can do the same thing and it could last me up to two days.



CAMERA: (winner? duh!)



N95, OF COURSE!!! 5mpx with flash, autofocus, and 30fps video > than 2mpx, NO video, NO autofocus! lol.







i gotta go on a break. to be continued.......

google maps the best ever created.
apple rules. The best innovation ever.
i phone buyer's , if you want gps, pull out your pocketbook, cause you won't get it in the i phone. want a good camera that is with you alway's in your phone. You won't find it in the i phone, 2meg with no auto focus or flash. why even bother to put a camera in the i phone. apple save's money by putting a cheap camera in the i phone and leaving other good feature's out. apple want's to attract people with the look's of the i phone and touch screen.
Reality is that today's consumer is quite sophisticated and able to evaluate a product, word of mouth is around and Iphone is being recommend  from one user to another, and the end the result is million sold.

Evaluation is not on sterile specs but overall user experience/benefits.
Consumers are free to decide and " massive Mac momentum" is their choice
as was already told by someone who use's the n95 and the i phone. the i phone has no 3g like the n95. i phone has 2g and it is more expensive on data than the n95 when there are no unsecured wi fi around.
what about the consumer. you don't care about them. software update's is what is good for the consumer, not i phone 2 if that's what is coming. Stop thinking about your pocketbook all the time nj3 and start thinking about the consumer.
Success is measured on the market place
Fact of life :



RBC Capital raises estimates on Apple based on ï¿½massive Mac momentum,ï¿½ European iPhone success

Thursday, December 06, 2007 - 08:48 AM EST



In a note to clients yesterday, analysts at RBC Capital Markets reiterated their "outperform" rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares and raised their estimates on the Cupertino California-based Mac-, iPod-, and iPhone-maker.



November data from the firm's Technology Adoption Panel point to 'massive Mac momentum' in the current holiday quarter. RBC expects 2.4 million Macs to be shipped in the holiday quarter, up 9% over last quarter's all-time Mac sales record (2.2 million units) and 47% over last year's holiday quarter. The firm expects worldwide Mac share to rise to 3.7% in calendar year 2008, up from an estimated 3.1% in calendar 2007, with Mac share of the U.S. PC market rising to 9.3% from 7.2%.



The analysts say that, based on store visits and meetings with carriers, Appleï¿½s iPhone has been received well in Europe. Appleï¿½s European iPhone sales are also ready to surge, with the productï¿½s launch in other nations and the expected rollout of a next-gen 3G iPhone in "the first half of 2008," the analysts added.



EPS estimates for FY08 and FY09 have been raised from $4.80 to $4.81 and from $6.00 to $6.02, respectively. Analysts upped thier target price from $205 to $215.



RBC Capital expects Apple to sell 400,000-500,000 iPhones in Europe in Apple fiscal first quarter 2008.



joe. i just like pissing nj3 off, because he call's the n95 no good and you and i know that is far from the truth. i have the n95 and it's fantastic.GUYS!!!! whats the nagging all about? Whos got the best phone? Or who wants to agree with u?

Respect each others choice of equipment. I am an Ipod fan and I respect the mobile phone product from them. But personally speaking I would rather go with a HTC Advantage X7500(too Huge!) or a HTC TyTN II because I believe Apple's main products are for Blokes per se, cos they are so so user friendly! Even a dumb ass can start using them. And with the kind of publicity they go about before launching a product lasting more than a year.

Nokia N95 is a very good phone for certain folks and trust me on this no cellphone in the world has a network which nokia provides(some cheap nokia's have moderate n/w's)

Iphone is a good phone again for certain people but it could have been made better!
some geezer lower down was defending his iphone by saying it can play gameboy advance games.



thats great.



that softwares been out on the N95 for maybe a year?
to Leo earlier comment about jailbreak. Getting apps for my n95 was a big headache also with the certificate, I was lucky with my 1st n95 as I got a certificate from symbian signed but my new one is like naked can't get nothing. With iPhone its so easy that I get new stuff almost everyday
his name is not queer, that's just his gsm arena net id. But rock u definatly put him in his place. I have both phones n95 is awesome and I'd still be using it if the screen didn't just shutdown for no reason its only 8 weeks old. Oh well at least my iPhone is made of stronger stuff
i wantd 2 knw dat does d iphone reaiily gt hot or not if u talk a lot...does it hav a screen lock like a password or so...n hwz d phone overall worth d buy or not??plzz let me knw...
the n95 can hold a max of 32 gb when the card come's out. If you call this other guy queer, rock then you must be queer. Take's one to know one.
try see what street is coming up next with your i phone at night. you can't with no navigation. my n95 also has voice guidance. i don't have to pay for a separate gps system, like you rock.
thats a GREAT deal on an iphone, johnny! try to get it "jailbroken" if you can. INSTALLER app will let you enjoy your new phone so MUCH MORE!!! ^_^



i admit, having a "locked" iphone is REALLY no fun! i mean, its still good cuz ya still got an ipod, phone, AND have access to the "REAL" internet! but having it "jailbroken" opens it up to all these cool 3RD PARTY apps which lets you do pretty much WHATEVER you want with your phone!



also, wtf is up with these "rotateme" programs!?! what, is the n95 TRYING to be more like the IPHONE!?! COOL!!! lol. why would you even want to "rotate" your screen when its so little...
im getting on in montreal for my b-day from my cuzin friend for 400

an ipod with phone function... that's all there is...
rock. my battery is fine on my n95. if i did use it alot and it got low at least if i wanted a fully charged battery put in i could put one in. try that on the i phone, i don't think so!! ha ha ha!!
i have talked to 2 people who have used the n95 and the i phone and they both like the Iphone much better. why would i want a cell phone with so many less feature's tnan the Iphone
before you "fanny-packs" dis on the iphone, heres an idea. why dont you TRY ONE!!! yeah, thats right! whatsa matta!?! scared youre gonna LIKE IT!?!?! oh yeah, and "hacking" an iphone aint that hard - its not rocket science. after all, youre "smartphone" users, arent you!? ^_~
I habe this two phones, w960 and lg ku990... i think the w960 is mutch better...but the videon from lg ku990 is fantastic ( 120fps )

for me,, tehre is just fine phones,, w960 and lg ku990...



And you people,,, what do you think between this two phones, w960 and lg ku990?





APPLE.. PLEASE... PRODUCE A NEW IPHONE WITH 3.2MPX CAMERA, 3G, WIFI AND A VIDEO CAMERA WITH 120MPX.... will be so the best phone of the world.... but yet.. this iphone is far away from the oders... w960 is better,,, an lg ku990 have a great video...

post your opinion people... tanks...

apple didnt re-invent the phone.



they made one with deprived features.



the selling points are an internet browser which is javaless and flashless.



cover flow...breakthrough...



and its just a bit crap tbh.



Battery life depends also from your position in the network, if your phone sits in a marginal coverage area or somewhere in the house where the signal doesn't quite reach well  it is going to constantly try to send its id to the network therefore draining that battery !

Obviously the battery life stated by the manufacturer it's in ideal conditions...
Belkin makes the car charger, same as ipod.....

www.belkin.com
Thanks for the reply but the specifications for Iphone state a standby time of 250hrs (i.e >10 days) and talk time of 8 hrs...with what I am experiencing these specs look like a dream.....

i just hope that battery life improves...

has anyone bought a car charger for the iphone...(i mean do they make it??)
i had aplay with one the other day and i must say it is sexy to play with but it has nothing good about it FFS it doesn't even send files via bluetooth but thats good old apple for ya. no 3g . price tag if far to high for an average joe phone



would have thought apple would have done something betetr than this!
Hello. Pls i'd lyk 2 kno which is a betr fone 2 buy. the iphone or the nokia n93i. ..nd which has a betr nd clearer camera. Thanx.why own the n95 8gb if you think it's no good rocky!! so you can hear your music. i have seen the i phone and messed around with it and i don't need to own one to comment on it.
rock, why bother even having tv output on the i phone. why, so you can look at your crummy 2meg picture on the tv , especially with no auto focus. oh i get it now. it's so you can finally get some volume from your music player by turning up the tv. 8 gb you brag about but no a2dp and no volume. 1 tiny little speaker.
why ppl are talking high about iphone????. having an attractive face would not pay you always. if you are a smart guy, then have one smartphone that would meet your all daily needs. moving around with an iphone,but cannot catch a wonderful live moment, what a frustration!!!! instead of iphone, better u choose Armani/F700 of samsung or KS20/viewty/prada of LG. what extra is there in iphone what aforesaid  phones have. however we may not compare iphone with symbian based phones,like n95, SE 960 because of the difference in the OS. above all, iphone is not at all a better choise when i intend to exploit/enjoy vivid features.
Stop your uninformed comment's rock i have 4 gb which is enough for me and it's on a memory card not trapped inside the phone. what do you think you are a wrestler or something. i wouldn't go around with a name like that , that's for d a m n sure!
rock. touchscreen is available, not that it interest's me. i have seen a video of a guy that put it on his n95. you tube i don't care about, i would rather watch video's of my son. no video recording for you. Since when is 1 or 2 minute's forever from a cold start long for a gps lock, sometime's from a cold start i get a lock right away, all that without even agps which is even faster.  i'll give you one,qwerty, but the e90 has it. no volume for your music player and no a2dp, no voice dialing. a touch of my bluetooth while i'am driving and i'am dialing out without  touching my phone. no flash or auto focus for you rock.
THE IPHONE the most over-rated paperweight of the century. to all the people comparing it to the N95 dont.. its like comparing a rolls royce to a suzuki lol how is it supposed to revolutionise the mobile market if you have to get update after update on new applications,and then it stores and sends personal info back to apple HQ lol one word RIPOFF!!!!!!!!
what?!?!...your iphone cant load up anything more than picture and text in the browser?! what!?!?no video recording!?!?....what!?no ad2p bluetooth or data exchange???...what?no radio for a music phone?!?!?!...uc ant install 3rd party apps without paying or hacking?!?!!what!



yea i win

WHAT!?!?! the "king of phones" DOES NOT have a 3.5in TOUCHSCREEN!?!?! IT ONLY HAS A 2.8!?!?! WHAT!?! the king of phones DOES NOT have a QWERTY KEYBOARD!?!?! WHAT!?!?! the GPS takes FOREVER on a "cold start!?!?!" WHAT!?!?! i CANT watch all the YOUTUBE videos I WANT!?!?! WHAT!?! i need to have my .sis files "SIGNED" before i can USE THEM!?!?!? WHAT!?!?!?! i can get a "VIRUS" on my top-of-the-friggen-line "king of phones!?!?!?!" WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?!?!?!?!
ur right ross



and safari cant handle flash or java.

and it has no radio (music phone?!)



jesus

What a load of rubbish!!! overpriced, no bluetooth for data transfer. buy a viewty instead
Why don't we quit this useless antagonizing and stick to some more interesting REAL  hints info upgrades and so on ?
For those who say the iphone is crap but can't string a proper sentence in explaining there theory behind there comment must be either uneducated or completely stupid hint hint.



Ok you can't forward nor send mms messages but the new firmware update in febuary will allow you to send and forward text messages and also anable the usage of mms messaging and flash player will be enabled for sure.



Iphone is the best music and internet browser on any phone ever made.



Don't you guys out there be comparing the N95 brick to the iphone.



Iphone is not for those who can't afford one for exapmle someone uneducated who says silly words like its crap.











safari browser isi easy to use and
Too bad because you CAN forward messages
dis fone is crap...u can't forward messages usin d i-phone...!!..i bought d i-phone n sold it d nxt day...
oh and i know your average consumer wont hack the iphone but me and msny others even those with limited knowledge know wot the iphone is capable of. NO 3rd party apps? Dude you should see my home screen. Its so packed with features most of my mstes r scared to touch it. Lol
to sa60



Dude r u crazy! Just by me mentioning the certificate and selfsign you should have guessed that I hacked the n95 to death, I only choose smart phones cos I like to see what they can do. I liked my n95 its just to weak. The iPhone is awesome and very easy to hack that's why i like it, I'm counting down the days till the sdk release
Unfortunately the phone sucks. A beautiful but a shallow form. I'am bored and I have arranged to sell it. Never trust a commercial.

Does anyone else in the UK. feel a little bit as if their Jaw is perminantly dropped, now that they've found out that O2 have somehow managed to gain exclusive rights to the sale of I-phones?

Personally, i don't want an I-Phone, but is it just me?

or was that move was really below the belt.

(In a factual way, not a bashing way.. one of my numbers is with O2, i appreciate their wide network coverage.).
i have a problem with my iphone which is i can't display the messages tap (messages icon) so pls can u help me out there to fix it.

thanks
Oh also forgot in that ï¿½27.50 you get unlimited calls to any o2 number...  so if you had signed up for a ï¿½45pm 18mth contract in theory your saving ï¿½318 over the 18mths which means your easierly saving the cost of the phone.it won't be about anything for you rocky when your battery goes dead in a blackout, which might happen that much but when the rubber meet's the road you are screwed for replacing your battery in the i phone, but i guess you will turn on your n95 8gb then , since you said you own it. one of the best feature's on a cell phone is the music player and with a2dp i'am never wrapped up in wire's. A cell phone without a2dp is for people living in the past rocky. no gps either on the i phone. Look how many other top of the line phone's have gps. htc, i mate, nokia.

yes. the iphone speakers are loud enough for an mp3 player. its not THE loudest but its not real soft, either. i would say about an 8/10 for the speakers.



I love this phone but I wouldn't buy it because  of its lack of 3.5G support, because I'm not free to choose the company I want and because I 'm not free to install the software I want on it. And I'm pretty sure there's many people like me. I don't know to what point is this strategy of marrying to a single telephone company a good idea. I guess they have done their numbers right, but I'm sure they would sell tons more of iphones if they opened it up.
can someone tell me if this phone is LOUD?
mobile review.com i phone as a phone. probing the main function. a test was done clearly stating that the n95 gave an extra 60 minute's worth of talk time in the day. good luck i phone boy's in a black out. no popping in a new battery for you! no charging no electricity! i was in the ontario black out a few year's back and sometime's you could make call's out.
hey rocky, you called me son once, so i guess you must be about 70 year's old because i'am 44. Be careful when listening to music thru your wired headphone's in  case the wire wrap's around your little weeney. 1 eighth of  an inch. when it's hard that is!
that's absolutely right! magnesium. I have seen the i phoney and it has plastic on the back!!
Uhm N95 wont even last a day on a full charge whilst using all those features it has. What is the point of having a phone when you cant use any of its features.



Also the iphone is not made of plastic, the N95 however IS made of plastic I'm afraid, The iphone is made up of high scratch resistant glass front with chrome rim and anodised aluminium back. There is no plastic on the iphone, unlike Nokia's N95 which is nothing but plastic for the whole casing, it feels cheap and tacky with boring Nokia menus.



Lucky for me I'm getting iphone free on an o2 contract, ï¿½25 per month for 600 minutes and 500 texts with unlimited Data ;) How? Lets just say I'm related to someone very important at O2 :)





er the front bit your on about, what about the rest, back side, screen etc
I think the Apple iPhone is a good comparison to the Motorola Ming. I normally hate Apple, but they surprised me with their iphone. Who needs a card slot with 16 GB!

PLEASE tell me which is better: Ming or Iphone. I am thinking of buying



THNX
Yeh I work for Virgin mobile in fact im sat at work now in the call centre a friend of mine got one of these imported, what a bag of crap



The battery dies after 5 mins and the camera aint anything special... il stick with me N95 chers ;), i can record enough video to put on youtube... camera is great, battery life could be better but with that huge screen well its fair
hi all

GOOOOOD NEWS

good news. iphone now can record vdo for 10 sec with 10-15 fps for at 2 mpx. iphone is getting life. thanks to the devloper. find it at www.monsterand friend.com
Bought a LG Viewty, didnt like so sent back, next was a N95, was nice but in my opinion nothing special also was faulty so sent back, next was the iphone and wow quite simply the best phone i`ve ever owned. Everything about it is amazing, to me seems a good couple of yrs ahead of the competition.  Taking pics in evening and low light is the only downside
If it would be a lemon it you would not sell two million units and growing,

consumers are smarter than you, it sells by word of mouth.

Keep on wishing it's a lemon one day you'll wake up.
i phonw... big mess... from php 50k (usd 1250) it's now down to only php 10k, brand new(usd 250)... tsk tsk tsk... big big mess...
two million people bought lemons, consumers are like pigs lead to the slaughter it comes down to how new a product is or how well its being advertised or being pushed by the salesman, i sell phones for a living and i push phones that are revelent to that person not all salesman are like that and will push the new "in" product.. why push a product on a customer if it is inferior.. so two million people have the iphoney dosnt mean that that it's a good product

as for rock

why bag peoples opinions out homes if you dont like your own opinion being tested it is a great looking phone and yes the operation system is more advanced than the microsoft operating system on the n95 but apple is just dressing up a inferior product to be stylish and a gymick.... thats all respect all opinions dude its a free unbiased world and yes I DO OWN AN IPHONEY.....
apple should really be including a hearing aid with the i phone, so you could at least hear when your phone ring's or hear your music!!
Two million people got it



people plz help i m really crazy about this phone but some rumours are stopping me to buy it like bluetooth aint workin properly same for wifi as well as sms service and the loudspeaker  what should i do plz suggest me it'll be very helpfull if someone who iz using iphone does dat for me

thank you
the opinion of two million people and growing is :

I like the Iphone, the price is ok and I buy it !




the i phone also need's navigation desperately!
yo nick!



are you serious!?! well thats good cuz allz i can find on the 'net are free themes and the apps i can find all need to be signed, lol.



im prolly gonna get the k850 to replace my n95-2 next! ^_^ for some reason my n95 just DOES NOT impress me for some reason. but thats just me. lol.



yeah, i know right!?! the vid recording is gonna be d shiznatz!!! now if only the iPhone has FLASH. w3rd.
erm "r0ck" if that is your real name, I get my applications free from around the internet. they're everywhere and of course i can self sign my own applications if i need to. 99.8% come signed anyway!



You cannot not NOT say the iphone is more open to 3rd party applications because it isnt.



also the 3rd party applications on the N95 are better because they can utilise the featuers already present in the iphone.



The iphone applications just fix the things the iphone should already have.







The video recording however looks very impressive. 2mp resolution at 40 frames a second is insane!
Apple's iphone is really cool!!! Don't hesitate to buy it!!!
its very good phone
Don't get the i phone, it sucks.. not supported by lots of programmes too..
my understanding is that there is also no sms forwarding possible, unless something new has come out. this was an issue with the i phone.
ok, i got the information about bluetooth and file transfering and about the batterry.but mainly i'm looking for this information whether i may send more than 160 word's standard sms...i mean can i send 200-1200 word's sms. i have to use more than 160 words for my smses ...so please someone tell me if i may be able to send more than a standard sms...

thanks

Sayed
no you can't transfer via bluetooth from phone to phone. the guy below you JUST said that.
can i send more than 160 word's sms through iphone. pls someone write it here. one more thing, can i transfer songs or data's from iphone to another cell phones or another phone to iphone. please post it down here. i really really need to know this features. i'm getting this iphone in a week, if i can't send more than 160 word's sms then i'm really going to be depressed for sure.

i have most of the opinion and i must say, iphone sounds really great to me. specialyy the touch screen feature. like old startrek serial.its great.
I have had the iPhone for about 2 months now.

The bluetooth: yes you cant transfer files from another phone or computer.

Loudspeaker: great to be honest, nothing to complain about.

Battery: fair, if you use everything in it, wifi, ipod, sms and phone all day, you'll need to charge every day.

Wifi: works great, almost as well as my macbook pro.

Reception: Clear as can be.

A few annoying things you might want to look at: cant transfer filed with BT, cant shoot a video. These are the only 2 things that annoy me, but hey, you cant have it all.

Great great phone overall!
Someone posted the following info below about the iphone.  Can anyone verify this? It is hard to tell what is fact here and what is bull****.





updates coming in february to make bluetooth messages possible and update to use your camera as video camera .watch out fot the updates .coming soon to your iphone.....
typing this on my iPhone which i got today and its amazing!

dude namit ..the phones fine many of my frnds got it in india ..theres no problm with the bluethooth its just that its not meant for file transfer its only for headset ..the wlan works jus fine as far as i hv seen no problems ..only the loudspker aint that loud .
the n95 has had 3rd party applications since time began. We don't need to hack the system in order to make them work
ever heard of 3rd party apps, s0n!?
Well until then if there is no official release of this BS rumours that "updates coming in February to make Bluetooth messages possible and update to use your camera as video camera"  I would not believe it, apple should make it possible in the first release. Stop using people to encourage that is not exist.



replaced nokia n95 with iphone . best move ever ... updates coming in february to make bluetooth messages possible and update to use your camera as video camera .watch out fot the updates .coming soon to your iphone.....

n95. you can now watch you tube on your n95. yt player by samir: you tube on your s60.
all u guys should stop fussing so much the freaking features are amazing it does lack stuff but apple wont let go that easy ......its providing updates and its gonna be one kick ass phone.



PS and please dont cry about the memory its the largest in its class there is no phone except for the nokia N81 or something.....PS



This is a message to all phone maufacturers.



PLEASE make your all your phones with low loud speaker and loud when using headphones. Then we wont have to listen to the latest 50 cent and justin gayberlake when were on the bus, train, tram etc when going to work
allan



do you own an iphone? the reason I ask is because I have both n95 and iphone and let me tell you iphone is better for music and net. I dont use my moto bluetooth headphones with ni5 because n95 eats battery as it is, the screen is fine for browsing but a tad to small. I work for panasonic and people always say that samsung is better cos of high contrast ratio and they make mainly lcd tv, but when thy compare picture quality to our plasma they have to admit defeat. forget what is on the paper its all about performance and I say the iphone performs well. Ps 9 out of 10 people dont even know what their phones are capable of, so do they need features they wont use and have poor battery or a stable phone that does the basics well
i agree as well, no volume compared to the n95 music player and no stereo bluetooth for the i phone.  Allan's previous comment's i also agree with.
It's going to be quite interesting in may.  Iphone 2 with 3g capability should be interesting and i'm really hoping at has a better camera on it too.



No complaints with the 1st apple iphone as apple can only get stronger and stronger as to be perfectly honest i'm bored with Nokia and Sony Ericsson



Example nokia don't have any new ideas at the moment for example the nokia 8800 and then the sorocco in which there both identical, nokia 8800 and the 8800 8gb again there both near identical



sony ericsson hasn't come up with anything new for ages.



I'll stick with the iphone as it's the best music and internet player out there and of course the battery life is awesome.



It's been voted must have gadget for this year so apple are definately doing something right.



hey apple you might want to release the iphone in India .........

and plz get a new update like blutooth data transfer ,,louder ringtones ,, 3G,, etc
letting all australians know that iphone will be released by vodafone in march as vodafone is adding the edge technolagy to there network to support the iphone in early january
No Video recording, and Blue-tooth you can use only for headset..
hey,i wanna buy this phone and i need somebody's advice,is it recording video and what about it's bluetooth plz send me
well the iphone only has a wifi store...which isnt very useful now issit
music player is a bit limited if you ask me.



All other music phones have a radio.



Get the N95 which also has a 3.5mm jack and digital radio AND standard radio AND stereo bluetooth AND a music store you can use on the go.
think i want this for the looks gonna stay with my TyTN and get the ipod touch and hackit to bits :) WIN WIN WIN
hi guys .i want to knew that iphon is good for listening music or not .
Yes, i only bought it for the looks. The performance is terrible. Battery life is poor. And cant send files in an easy way.

Think twice before you buy this.
jailbreaking is a doddle and come feb 08 loads off apps will be available... Each to there own devices I say....On my old phones including n73/n95 I never used the internet or email functions, just to awkward to use. With the iphone everything is just so simple and really is a pleasure to use. The maps is truly a wonderful program and I use everyday as I`m a mobile tradesman. I seriously can`t rate this phone high enough, operating system seems so stable, processor can run at 600/700mz which is even quicker that the psp! so have a feeling some great games will be out next year.



Can`t see the point in slagging off other phones because each is different, its what suits you in the end, boring world if anyone liked the same thing! but the iphone is definately the way forward... people will always look at something like a phone and see what it doesnt have rather than what it does have and whats its really capable of.
i hope iphone v2 designed exactly like iphone v1...but the features must changed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3 and above mpx camera with aotufocus and xenon flash,120fps video recording!!!!
The iphone will be released through telstra at the end of january 08. They will only get 6 at a time! What the?
se 23. i find the n95 has everything i need and i like the styling as well. i had the samsung d900 and i really liked it, then i bought the n95. wasn't sure to sell d900 but i find having 2 phone's at the same time, one sit's around sometime's. as for the i phone, personally it just doesn't appeal to me and i find apple is holding back to much from the consumer. one guy made it short and sweet but it made sense to me. it's a ipod with a phone attached to it, we are all differant though. If you enjoy it and don't get bored with it that's what matter,s, but what's with having to do all the jailbreaking, does the average consumer know how to do all this. also if there was no electricity apple doesn't give you the option of putting in a fully charged battery.
HEYYYYYYYY GUYS



check out the new photo board, by cedsoft it's on installer, or google cedsoft.



IT WILL MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY

moradi@hotmail.com
Open your eyes steve jobs!

This phone is far away behind in functions!

Wish you do a better next time...

Still with yours macs but cellphone never(at this time)oh and people who say iphone is crap and a waste of money. Im going to buy my first macbook in jan because of the iphone. So apple can have more of my hard earn money. Apple products are class! Nj3 whats the best way to go about getting shares? I have great faith in apple now!
guys,is there any software for locking images,video folder for iphone
Guys. You can buy a bluetooth thing that will be placed at the bottom part of the iphone (usb) for stereo headset. now you can listen to music with bluetooth headset!
The iPhone outsold ALL Windows mobile devices in Q3 in north america, combined, Steve Ballmer said last January that the iPhone wouldn't get more than 2-3% marketshare, and that MS would attain 60-80% marketshare. Wrong on both fronts, dude.
this is to the comment about the spare battery in case of black out for the n95.



the battery life and talk time last 1/2 as long as any other phone on the market in the first place so your going to need that spare battery :)



the iPhone is exactly the ipod touch that can make calls and send text, so get yourself a cheap pre paid and an ipod touch and save yourself some money.



i have found nokia used to dominate but ever since the take over of ericsson by sony, the market domination of sony over the mobile market was inevitable. so go get a sony.



have a good christmas
so the dudes iPhone had a faulty antenna. GET IT REPLACED through apple with apples 1 YEAR WARRANTY program for godssakes!!!





on the other hand, there is NO warranty replacement for the n95's BELOW AVERAGE gps performance. lol.
iPhone can now SPEED DIAL, SEND MMS, INCREASE RINGER VOLUME(although this is old news), and TRANSFER FILES "wirelessly" to a mac OR to ANOTHER iPhone!



geez, what will they come up with next!?! ^_~





on the other hand, the n95's GPS function "eats" away at its already HORRIBLE battery life. tsk tsk tsk...
9to5mac claims that Apple will reach approximately 5 million in iPhone sales by Macworld San Francisco in January 2008 which would bring them half way to their goal of 10 million iPhones sold by the end of 2008.



According to 9to5mac's sources, approximately 1 million of these sales are through Europe, despite reports of sluggish sales. The news comes shortly after reports that iPhone's sales have exceeded Windows mobile marketshare by capturing approximately 27% of the smartphone market this past quarter.



I sell my n95 2 weeks ago, and now I have iphone. now I wanna rate these two phone from 100:

iphone 98/100

n95 30/100
does it accept .jar or .sis games ?
Dont even try to buy this stupid phone, This is the 1st apple phone and they have no experience like Nokia and realy bad one.

if you open the HW of this phone its taped like they never had phone, it freeze alot.

I dont recomend
Listen guys, N95 and iphone today the best and # 1 phones in the world..Iphone missing couple of things, but im sure they will add on 2nd iphone, or this iphone by update..But N95 has a allot of options and futures, specially camera and mp3 speaker..But i love both phones, and i cant say this is good and other not..
east or west i phone is the best !!

I hv taken i phone in exch of Dopod 838 pro !! is that ok fokes !!
goooood koooool so far
can i have an iphone with an operator except AT&t?does it make any problem?
we'll let you off this time mate
why does everyone get the impression you have to pay for symbian applications? I've never paid a penny. Whatsmore the signing process is sooo easy (and all without hacking the phone?)
To be honest I was one of them people who was never going to buy an iphone, I was originally going to wait for the N82 but then one day when I had time to kill, walked into carephone warehouse and started playing with an iphone, never in a million years had I planned to get one, but after playing with it and finding it absolutely brilliant and much better than I ever imagined, within an hour I was home and had already unlocked it to work on my exsisting o2 sim!.. So please dont slate the phone unless uve owned one or atleast tried it out for yourselves..
I agree se23, dont buy this phone on contract, buy it then hack it (and yes it really is that easy!) get a cheap month by month contract like o2`s ï¿½25 pm for 400 mins, 1000 txts, unlimited data, then if in 6 mths the new iphone 2 comes out sell your iphone for 200 odd quid and get the iphone 2, i would never buy a new phone on an 18 mth contract....
hi guys



I did work in mobile phone shops for about 10 years, I even had my own shop but closed it cos of dodgy partners and had my first cell at 17yrs old I'm now 32. Someone again posted all the negatives we all know about when you could easily track back and read them. My input is!!!!!! Do not buy this phone on contract, if you buy it you must unlock it to use 3rd party sw or the phone is boring! I wouldnt buy one now cos we r so close 2 iphone 2. What your advice be to person like me who has n95 & iphone? And i still say iphone is good. Also if anyone thinking of buying n95 why dont u push them to go for n95 8gb instead of being in iphone forum? My reason for being here is i have got the phone. I listen to what u say but its only the actual owners input that i take on board if i want to buy a phone. But whichever phone i get ill hack it to death cos thats what i do!Its quite a nice style, but my cousin had this phone and well..... It broke straight away, my uncle also had the same problem.
is it true that in iphone one cannot send and receive files with other phones via bluetooth???????
Apple iphone is available in Malaysia but not officially launched yet. It is the most beautiful device I had ever seen. I recoomend it to all who want to see the future now.
I love iphone too, and i was owner about 3 months...But today i sold it, because i want wait on 2nd iphone..There was missing couple of programs, as MMS, SMS forwarding and more..But still it is cool and nice phone..I will wait for 2nd iphone, and i will buy, if apple will add whatever people need...
kelvin

yes you can use Iphone in Malaysia but you will have to unlock it first, you can get Iphone in Low Yat Plaza.
Thanks nj3



but Im so happy, I was at the barbers talkin about getting a macbook, and a guy there had 3 macbook pro's all refurbs. he used to work at a mobile shop I used to do business with. any way he said cos its me I can have the 15inch for ï¿½500 pounds. Im using it right now on a trial. I am def gonna buy this one. This thing is class baby. thanks for your help but this is a bargain for a legit laptop
Everybody is first time user of iphone,the kind we got was exceptionally weird. Blutooth but cnnot transfer,only itunes to download music,no video & flash unlocked could lock by mistake. Apple has started it must now hurry up with next model.The only way as Nokia SE Sam are releasing every month.Otherwise as google hav realised they should follow their seniors for survival.If upgraded with improved unversal set is not released by march 08,it will vanish///////
Great design, BUT the WORST Features ever... no mms, useless bluetooth, no mp3 ringtones from music library, etc, etc, etc...

I wanna sell mine...
an ipod with phone function. thats all there is ...there isn't anymore
hi guys i have taken iphone in last week please let me know How to make own Ringtone and how to make mp3 in ipod please et me know on mail



Regards

dhaval vora
just to set things straight apple have no plans to release a new iphone next year!



there will not be an updated handset till 2009 so where ever this info bout next year is coming from its wrong
This is very nice toy. It's truly sexy :)) The only major problem in my opinion is lack of 3rd party software like GPS, dictionaries and etc. I am pretty sure Apple will release public iPhone API in order to enable software wendors. And then nothing will stop iPone to control the market share. I have two phone HTC Elf and now my new toy iPhone. HTC Elf has a lot of features and tons of software. I would love to see Microsoft's .NET runtime on iPhones but I guess it will never happen.

Personaly I love it and especially because I got mine for only $32. www.squareauction.com is the place. If you don't believe me go to

my username legolas.

can anyone tell me what is going to release at feb. i heard that it will be programs or firmware ?!?! and if i already have an unlocked iphone can i install them ??
Se23 wait !

They are coming out with a very thin

Macbook nanoflash drive no moving parts

its only three weeks away ......

they are changing the rules again ...

You'd be very disappointed !

Nj3
I was between iphone and htc touch..after a lot of consideration i decides to buy htc and i though i was right! now my friend bought an iphone and when i compared them i concluded that iphone is by far better! main disadvantage though is the lag of bluetooth but it has a bigger and higher resolution screen and their browser cannot be compared for sure! also htc doesnt play youtube videos!

i think i'll buy an iphone !!
I still don't understand how this can be a smart phone, yes it now has 3rd party developers but it still can't multitask so there is no switching between apps!
jessica

your videos need to be in iPhone format, use Videora, its free and easy. Once you convert your video in videora it wall automaticly put the video in movies in iTunes so u just have to sync movies and that's it
Can Anyone please tell me how to download movies to my Iphone. I cant seem to figure it out. I tried Itunes but it doesnt work either.



Thank you
I am Agreed with moncef abbad.
From Zezima,



Guys im wondering if iPhone comes with a navigator if you do know the answer to this question. Runescape owns guys :DDi dont hate the i phone i luv it i was even thinking about buying it before it was released i was dreaming about it forget about the prize i thought i will buy one for sure but all my hopes went flat once i found out that i phone is missing many features also most of em are simple features needed by a cellular user for daily use ... i dont wanna buy it but i still like the design the display and the remaining features but for its high prize buying such a phone (with those missing functions) is a foolish thing so maybe ill wait for a better i phone in the future , maybe an i phone with a drag down key board (also with the same touch screen) and with better blue tooth functions (forget about the camera i dont care about it) and with better music features like u dont need i tunes to transfer music to the phone . orite i know u all will hate me maybe so have a nice day im out ...
you can actually forward a message, send picture, send an email, voice recording and a lot more stuff you can do with your iphone.. all you have to do is downlaod and install the said features using the "Installer" icon on your iphone..
hi.. i have a question.. i started to be curious with this application (PERL DEVELOPMENT, under the Installer icon) that's why i try to download it.. after installing it nothing seems to happen, but when i start downloading other application it can't install as in it won't INSTaLL at all.. before i try to download this PERL application, its just easy for me to downlaod.. can i know what happen to my iphone?? and what's this PERL app. and what can i do so that i can download application again??!! pls. reply asap!! thanks!!
I just got an unblocked iphone but when i try to put music from my PC, that doesn't work.

Anybody who know how to put music to iphone from PC please show me how!!!!!!!!!
I think your find that alot of iPhone owners have owned nokias before.n95 is very much outdated now, rickerty slider mechinism plastic small screen, crashes alot, massively thick and brick like and can imagine seen being used in some 80s film. Time nokia tried making a phone that is atleast half up to date. You nokia users have been fobbed off now for so long with dodgy interfaces and that same boring nokia look
if iPhone is unlocked correctly all features will work bar visual voicemail. Several programs available for instant messaging once phone is unlocked
Questions:

1)if we get to unlock the phone will the other features still work? the internet for example?

2) Will the internet work only on wifi areas? what happens if there is no wifi?

3) Does it have any kind of instant messaging?
I own an iphone but I am going to give it up.

The speakers and vibration are way too weak.

Everything else is nice, but daily miss calls and sms are really bad...
whats all this rubbish about its great for their first attempt. technology such as the iphone is hardly new to them. Apple have been round for ages making computers and they could easily make a phone better than this.



Are their first phones supposed to look like nokias first phones or something?



i couldnt possibly buy an iphone, it doesnt actually do anything
SE 23  don't bother with those Iphone haters, they are looser not worth  wasting time and effort for.

Focus on Apple shares they will go up 20 % between now and End of Jan 08, they have sold FIVE million Iphones and signing important contracts for movie rentals with Twenty Century Fox, that you will download on the Iphone, Nokia is REALLY WORRIED !!



but with the technolagy do you not think tjey could have still incorparated this? look at other phones that have got all this and more i.e the lg viewty?
The phone is great to use. It is so easy and the screen is fantastic.



the problems I personally have is



1) not 3g or hsdpa which is a big problem considering the full hsdpa of handset when out and not in wifi area.

2) no 3 meg camera minimum or flash

3) no video recorder.

4) not send group texting



Obviously Apple had to start somewhere and I am sure these problems will be rectified in the next generation of IPhone but overall its a great phone which shows a lot of promise for future generations from Apple.

Firstly jay jay I apologise for getting personal, not like me...



1st Nokia and lg phone i dont know, had a nokia 2110 back in 1994 cost me about 300 quid even back then, was supposed to be the rolls royce of mobile phones back then...



Your right to a degree but.... The good thing with an iphone is that you can just go and buy the thing without signing up for a contract in a shop, I payed 30 quid to get it unlocked so basically 300sih for an iphone with no contract is`nt too bad business in my eyes....
Thank you alas some one with some scence, thats the point im trying to get across!! well its still early days for teh i-phone so i shall see how many i get returned with software faults etc.
@ anas



we can say whatever we want when we want
this is a nice handset & very beautiful, nice feature, exciting colours, nice looking
Hi do you know how to get iTunes on my iPhone as I have a aim free one it did not come qith it thanks
hi do you think I should go foe the apple iPhone or the sidekick of or the sidekick slide thanks



Last issue of forbe's magazine. Can anyone catch Nokia the cell phone giant!!! 1 billion customer's!!!!!!!!
" and the iphone is useless "  Pity millions worldwide don`t agree with you there! Also remember the iphone won best device of 2007 in numourous publications, and to think that was on apples 1st attempt! Nokia have been in the business for donkeys years and still can`t device a phone with the wow factor, fair enough the N95 has lots of features but it doesn`t really look that nice and certainly is`nt a head turner.Vodafone in Germany even took Tmobile to court and LOST over the Iphone exclusive, that is how they fear the Iphone success, and yes,

without 3G and bluetooth file transfer
people who have used the iphone say in noisy place's you can't hear your call's coming in!
with the iphone in your pocket if it will even fit in there the volume isn't loud enough to begin with then the LITTLE speaker at the bottom will get muffled from your pocket= MISSED CALL"S!
Iphone is 15 grams heavier because is made of steel and glass

not cheap plastic, Ignorant people may not be impressed by the stock price but money managers, smart investors and analysts are, and so are the five million users.
too bad it has an obsolete user interface and operating system
The n95 is not any bigger than the iphone. You are screwed in the head buddy. Thinner but longer and wider than the n95. the n95 is shorter but thicker than the i phone and not much at that!  Even a 5 year old could figure out this equation!
iPhone and Nokia N95 is same bloody size when you think about it logically.



iPhone is thinner but longer, while N95 is shorter but fatter so it all balances out
And dimensions are a mathematical  calculation, not an opinion
still 5 million phones  and VERY successful I know it bothers you but that is a fact of life !
N95 dimensions : 99 x 53 x 21 mm, 96 cc

Iphone dimensions : 115 x 61 x 11.6 mm   82 cc

Iphone = smaller
apple comes with very good ideas but they have to do more to inpres me

the i phone is an exelent divise put the glass screen can easly broke and the i phone is very big IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT IT IN YOUR POCET

Is it too difficult to understand that what makes the difference is OSX

and its user friendly platform that any computer illiterate uses right away, and not the hardware, bluetooth, speaker , video and bla bla bla...
If you say so, but Apple sold 5 miliion Iphones in five months and became the number one mobile internet platform with OSX
the i phone it is a huge thing i would not call it a mobile phone i would call it a size 11 sliper
You should know T3, Stuff magazine and most every other publication has already named the second revision iPhone out later this year as the gadget of 2008 and it hasnt even been announced yet!



They say there is no doubt it is the most anticipated and will be the best gadget of 2008 unless competition step up their game, pointing to Nokia I presume mainly.
Apple created the keyboard and mouse you're using to type on this forum.



Nokia will never have Multi touch like the iPhone because it is patented to Apple, and being an all round technology company they will have the resources that will lead to them knock Nokia from its top spot.



Nokia has boring menu systems which haven't changed in 10 years! There is no innovation with Nokia.



I think eventually Nokia will be phased out of the mobile market altogether by Apple, Sony Ericsson and Samsung, even Motorola. They will end up like Sega has in the video games industry, producing bits of software here and there but no longer competing in hardware. Nokia are in very deep trouble, like Apple were back in 1997 before Steve Jobs came back, on the brink of closing down completely.



The only way they can claw their way back is to start showing more innovation in product design both in and out.
agree with below
Nokia phones change all the time. They get more features with every model thats brought out. SO shut up.



and please, "this is apples first attempt"



yes well you might find apple have been making computers for years now and i don't think adding bluetooth, MMS or a video camera would have been too difficult...
To all the N95 lovers out there, right now the N95 may have more features but once Apple get to grips with the market the next generation of iPhone will have everything the N95 and its successors (N96) have spec for spec.



Then it will come down to a case of who has the better design, innovation and user interface/experience. When this happens Nokia is in serious trouble because it simply cannot compete with Apple on this front unless they copy them like Windows copies every version of Mac OSX.



Vista is a carbon copy of TIger which we  Mac owners had 2-3 years ago. Now we have Leopard which is even better. The next version of Windows in 6-8 years time will be Leopard under a different name and slightly redeisgned by Microsoft.



Once Apple reach this stage in 1-2 years Nokia is in serious serious trouble. Their no.1 crown in the mobile market is wobbling! And they know it is!
With the iPhone you have to look at the bigger picture, this is Apples first attempt at a mobile phone. The lack of MMS, video recording and Bluetooth file transfer is all fixable with a simple software update. It is just a question of when that update will come, which I'm sure is not too far off.



The phone is a dream to use and I cant wait for the second generation of iPhone. I used the Nokia N95 and it is nowhere near as fun or intuitive.



In 2 years time I foresee Apple exceeding Nokia in the mobile market. Apple are innovators and Nokia phones havent changed much in the last 10 years. In terms of Nokia design their phones have become the ugliest things on the market. Nokia are no longer big players its all Sony Ericsson and Samsung now.



Apple in the next few years will put technology into the iPhone that no one has ever heard of. They invented the CD drive, floppy dick drive, first with GUI on a computer, firewire, the mouse the list is endless, and they are certainly well on their way to reinventing the phone.Honestly, the only thing great about the Iphone is the user experience.. which is the 'touch screen'.. besides that.. NOTHING.. other phones beats its features since 3 years ago...
@ grEEnLihtER

i totally agree. u shouldn't expect too much too soon.

i would get 1 too but its way expensive in Guyana (approx. GYD$160,000 that's USD$800!!) in short, it would take almost 3 months full pay to do so
every things is ok  but......

3g not available!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
mark



if you want something thats stable and reliable AND "flashy" at the same time, go with the iPhone.



if youre looking for something that takes AGES to open up your music player, camera application, crashes and hangs CONSTANTLY, and also takes forever to get a "lock" on your GPS location - buy an n95.



oh, and dont forget the HORRIBLE 4 hour battery life.
Mark it depends what you want from a phone. The Nokia N95 is superior in every single way. The iphone is fashion and nothing else. If you look good buy the N95, but if you don't look good, and want to get attention buy the iphone or a porsche.
The iphone has no delivery reports. Why?
The only thing i want to know is if its a big phone, because i have the n95 but its way to big... i also have a LG choclate. Thats a good size... so can anyone telle me if he's big and heavy???

-XXX-
I have one and i`m impressed.

Yes id does not forward SMS, is not supposed to do so, if you need it as a 3-rd party you should get it from THE ORIGINAL SENDER not as forward. Also there are apps that can fix this. I use WI-FI so i do not care about EDGE 3G and other transfer data systems. Video call... come on let`s be serious, does it not enought that i hear your voice? I need to see your face to? No way. MMS come on.... what do i have e-mail client for? I can send 2 MP photos via e-mail. Can you do the same with your MMS? Do not think so.

Also the entire debate is about what he has what he does not do. Let`s take a look about how he LOOKS and FEELS. About the things that you can do WITH your fingers not by pressing joysticks/joypads/smart wheels etc. This is the part that i like most. I like that when i take it out of my pocket all the people look and say: WAW an iTouch... nope it is an iPhone.

And in my opinion the best revolutionary part of it is multytouch screen.

And let`s be serious this is the first edition of it. Let`s wait for next versions. They will improve it for shure.

Sorry i do not like it i LOVE it.
Hey everyone...



I just want to ask if there is some one ho could tell me if i should buy te i-phone.... I really dont know much about the i-phone, but i want to have it....

ix5u



i COUDLNT agree with you MORE!!!





tsepz



i d0nt work f0r apple so i REALLY d0nt have to convince you int0 buying 0ne!!! to each his 0wn, nahmsayin???



allz i heard about the n81 is that sometimes you get noisy pics(bad 2mp), handset is a fingerprint magnet(due to the plastic material), sound quality aint that great, cheap feel(again, due to the plastic material) and that the slider becomes l00se over time.



but then again what do i know i d0nt even 0wn one.
tsepz



u know that the iphone has NO 3G/HSDPA so ur kinda asking for the IMPOSSIBLE!!!



its like me asking you to p0st up a video link of your n81 having a 3.5in TOUCHSCREEN with a QWERTY KEYPAD, while playing/having 99% YOUTUBE CAPABILITY. y0u know what im sayin, h0mes!?!



and thanks t0 HACKING(n0wadays u d0nt even need that cuz of fw updates), the iph0ne now has SOME of the BASIC functions that were supposedly IN the iphone in the FIRST PLACE like, MMS, sms FORWARD/batch send, speed dial. dont ask me abt bt transfer cuz everyone know it DONT HAVE THAT.



just like not EVERY PHONE is an IPOD TOUCH, has a QWERTY KEYBOARD, has practically 100% youtube support and has a 3.5in TOUCHSCREEN.





catch what im sayin, h0mes???
no 3g! no video recording!no card slot!2MP only! No auto focus!I'd rather go for nokia n95-8GB
Apple QSX PATENTED   multI TOUCH TECHNOLOGY is going to destroy the other operating systems Symbian in the first place

People do not know the difference between one OS and another,

but FIVE million suddenly find an internet phone really easy to use.
I had an iphone, i could not tallk on the thing it is too wide too hold and after 15 minutes it heats up and causes you too sweat .Furthermore the call quality is rubbish and i think they have placed the camera in the wrong place, whenever i turn the camera on my finger goes over it the keypad is hard too use you often touch the wrong letter , in 2008 there will be alot better phones thaat will do more than the iphone does now
i have had an iphone 3(2 8gb and 1 4gb) different times. after that i had a razr2 and 2 nokia phones the n81 and the n95 8gb and to be honest the iphone was only better than the razr2. my personal fav was the n81 but i got rid of it because the camera sucked. i am now using the n95 8gb i like the best because its easy to use plus it has the best camera and video around. but if the n81 had the same type of camera as the n95 8gb(5mp) i would go back to it
How the hell do you break a screen on any device? I've got iPods and the iPhone and they are all in pristine condition, never broken one and I even have the first gen Nano! Its called taking care of your stuff!



Secondly why the would you not want iTunes on the on the iPhone? its the best music player ever. Everyone I know who own a computer PC or Mac runs iTunes!



Thirdly OSX is the smoothest and most stable OS on any platform and is already taken considerable market share from Windows Mobile. I've played with my friends O2 Orbit with Windows Mobile and it is juts shocking to use slow and clunky, everything takes ages to open and load!



iPhone will be open to 3rd party apps in early February as Steve Jobs has already officially confirmed. I suspect an iPhone 2 announcement at either Macworld in couple weeks time, which I am attending, or in the Easter announcements. US release May/June with UK getting a Oct/Nov release as with this one.



Finally when iPhone 2 is released later this year everyone on this forum slating Apple and iPhone will have to just wonder off with tails tucked between their legs. It will absolutely annihilate Competition on all fronts from Nokia, SE, Samsung. Also rest assured Apple will no doubt be releasing various iPhones in the shape of shuffle and nano esque designs/features.
try an iphone and your see what all the fuss is about, usability is 2nd to none, all the functions are perfectly made, the screen is made of a very strong glass, very much stronger than most of todays phones with the usual plastic screen.
Huge man it is huge i don't get it what is so different about the i phone? the camera is 2 mp its memory is found in other mobiles to and it is a big big trobule for any boody it can brake easly because of the glass scren oh my god what is so special about this dam thing?

Can anyboody tell me?
Hi if u go on the internet on the IPhone you can sign into messenger through website like: www.messengerfx.com and ebuddy
Surfer. spec's say silver for n95.
synchronizes your iPhone Calendar, Contacts, and Notes





http://nexthaus.com/syncForm/syncForm.php
If you read my comments, you'll see that i said that the N95 is superior, it's only that it's easier to live with a small or thin phone, than with a bulky one. Nokia does the bulkiest phones on the market, and the gray ones like the N95 classic and the N80 lose their colour. Nokia is the most expensive phone on the market, so it's kind of cheating when the N95 classic loses colour. On the other hand, i hate it that they built the N95 8GB in black and made it 150 eur more expensive. If nokia had made the N95 classic in black I wouldn't even consider buying the 8Gb version. And yes, the iphone has a better skin than the N95 classic.
n95 does not lose colour. 8gb no lens cover.
I want to buy it but i am not so sure about the camera can u record video?pls anser me
he surfer

i want your i-phone but i dont think you wanna send it to holland... haha



-XXX-

Mark I couldn't talk them into a porsche. I don't remember what they exactly said, but it comes close to something like when hell freezes.
rock



thnx for your awnser, im only girly girl... my collegs or the other names so...

i have the n95 but i hate it... im going to sell it... the only problem is that the i-phone is not out in holland... do you know where i can get it now?



-XXX-
And one more thing, the N95 classic loses color from it's skin. The N95 8GB, the black one, does not.

Same thing with N80.

P.S. I graduated 20 days ago, and my folks got me an iphone, although I wanted a N95 8GB or a leased porsche.
Awesome Phone!!!
Thanks for ur tip on "NES emu + 100 nes games." Unfortunatly i couldnt find any with that on ebay, the only one was the iphone with 150 extra apps and the fool wanted $1199 for it!! yh right..

thanks for all the help!

happy new year
mark



btw, the iPhone ORIGINALLY does not have msn messenger but again, if your iPhone is "jailbroken," you can install an im client that supports aol/.mac/googletalk/icq AND msn!



kinda like how you also have to "install" agile messenger or something like that on the n95-2 just to get the same thing - diff str0kes 4 diff f0lks, nahmean!? lol.



yeah, $600-700 sounds about right for an unlocked + jailbroken iPhone. although it really DOESNT MATTER if you get an "expensive" jailbroken one as there is only ONE WAY to "jailbreak" an iPhone. and d0nt worry about all th0se "extra" appz cuz theyre the ones you can install through the INSTALLER app anyways!!! but try to get one with the NES emu + 100 nes games if can tho cuz the nes ROMS cant be installed through the "intstaller."



surfing the 'net on prepay u most probably COULD NOT do on the iPhone cuz you'll need some sort of "data plan" for it to w0rk HOWEVER, who needs that when you can surf the web, play utube vids, check ur email, AND CHAT using those free wi-fi networks!!! ur house, maybe??? thats what i do! lol.



cheers, mate!
Mark. Good luck whatever your decision!
yeah thats where ive been looking for all the phones (ebay.com.au) i can pick one up for 600-700$ they are all unlocked and some of the expensive ones comes with extra apps! would i be able to surf the net with a prepay sim tho? or would it have to be a contract ?

cheers
surfer



haha! true. thats why i also bought the n95-2 bec of its color and slightly BIGGER screen and 8gb memory! personally, i like the c0lor black in a ph0ne.



true, the iPhone DOES NOT have delivery conf. which is a minor gripe of mine about it. still doesnt "take away" from the experience, tho!





mark



the iPhone ORIGINALLY was intended for at&t(usa) but now its branching out ALL OVER the world! uk, germany, france, some parts of asia iirc. i think there might even be an australian release date but d0nt quote me on that!!! lol.



it sounds like for what you already have(macbook/30gb iPod), the n95 MIGHT be a better fit for you. but in the end its still YOUR CHOICE to make! if ur thinking of getting an iPhone, eBay is your best bet cuz the "unlocked" iPhones theyre selling are pretty much 100% JAILBROKEN(3rd-party app support) which will further "enhance" your iPhone experience due to the SHEER number of available appz to be installed AT YOUR FINGERTIPS! just make sure you buy from a reputable seller and make sure to ask q's as well!!! i think maybe even ebay aus. has some... ^_^



and yes, having an "unl0cked" iPhone will make it accept ANY foreign simcard so your voda sim should work just fine.
a kick ass camera on the n95, good mp3 player with volume, gps , voice dialing, bluetooth transfer and a2dp. not found on the iphone! mp3 yes but no volume. surfer know's alot more than you !!
ive just had a thought rock!!

if i was to get the iphone.. would the internet capabilities be any use to me unless i had a contract. I am currently using a pre-pay vodafone sim. Would that cause a problem? Thanks
surfer you obviously dont know much about handsets!

the nokia n95 is no way superior to the iphone!

the iphone is unique, where as the n95 is just the same as any other handset with a poor battery life and numerous software faults!

surfer. The original n95 is the same design as the 8gb except the colour and slightly bigger screen. So is it silver you don't like. i have never found the n95 ugly, but i don't like it in black but that's just my preferance. i have a work shirt pocket where it fit's perfectly into and some of my personal shirt pocket's.To the person who left the comment and writing single text messages etc you forgot to leave a name! how do i do that? cos it would be a lot better if i cud do that some how!!

Cheers

Alex!!
Iphone is great but not worth the price, I work at Phones4U and have noticed that so many people come out of carphone warehouse disappointed by the price of iphone, they then sign up for a contract for LG Viewty and then buy an ipod touch there you have it, the bet of both worlds :)
The iphone is the ultimate phone.i've had many phones they include, nokia n95, htctynt,sony ericson w880,sony ericson k850i and a w950. I can honestly tel you that none of those phones come even close.even tough it doesnt have 3G or MMS the hole experience of the phone is briliant.the screen's resolution is the best out there and the internet is exelent
Theres a program on installer app that lets you view write and delete single txt messages in the same way all other phones do. Thats if you have it installed. As for the bluetooth I dont think it was rushed and they just missed it out, I think they just didnt want people file sharing music and taking there profits from itunes. The good points on the iphone far outweigh the bad. There not exactly bad point there er um just missing lol
that statement from me was relating to

http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/new...d=10860&pn=2
by the way!!
I agree with pretty much every statement and point made in this iphone story, i have had my ihpone now for around 2 months or so and i love it, but i do really feel it is let down by some of the most useful features that have been left out in what are normally obvious included features on all phones these days.

The main point i want to make is with the texting feature of the iphone, nothing to do with the keyboard or anything like that, its simply due to the fact that you cant delete one single message of a conversation, say for example i have a massive conversation with a freind and i want to delete one message they have sent then that means i have to say goodbye to the whole conversation which i just think is very silly and hasnt been thought out as much as i would have liked.

Dont get me wrong i love the chat feature on the iphone, how it looks etc but the practicality of it i think is very poor, some features on the iphone seem to have rushed as far as i can see.

Another annoying missing feature on the iphone is the bluetooth feature, again you expect this on say 7/10 phones these days and when you go and spend ï¿½300 or more on a phone you expect it to have fully working bluetooth so it can be used to transfer things with other phones with your friends etc, i just think to leave this feature out was lazy and poor designing as so many phones have that capability these days!!



Apart from these, i think the iphone is brilliant, but personally i think the lack of these features can let it down slightly due to the popularity of these functions that we are so used to.



I think other people will agree with this!! Thanks for reading!



Alex
that design l00ks SOOOO familiar. i w0nder where ive seen it before???



hmmmmmmmm.........
im getting my i-phone this week!!!!



yippie
The web browser that it offers comes with no other phones..... the surfing experience on Iphone is the best....

its seems that the trend f0r upcoming ph0nes n0wadays is t0 go t0uChScReEn!!! n0w why is that??? trying t0 "imitate" the "iPhone success??? LOL.
verizon voyager has built in gps and also flip's open, and more than likely it has bluetooth transfer. i mean what phone doesn't have bluetooth transfer except, well you get the drift!
I just LOVE MY IPHONE, it's probably the best touch phone on the market for the moment.
The iPhone is a great device and it puts the smart in smart phones. I am posting this opinion using the iPhone. Overall it is a great phone and it only has one problem. It doesn't have a video recorder but the designers of the phone are making an update to make the video recorder so you will be able to update your version later when it happens. As of right now it is version1.1.2. The other thing that I think should be updated is on the safari some games, videos etc. needs macromedia player which this phone doesn't not have and would be something to improve on. Also typing on this phone is such a breeze. You can't compare this phone with the LG Prada, verizon voyager, nokia n95, or the blackberry pearl. Everyone has their own opinion at eveything but this phone is not only for business it is also for entertainment which I use it for because I'm only a teen. So if you have extra cash and are looking to show of your phone I would recommend the iPhone.
Nick there are hundreds of apps ranging from emulators, email, messaging, office, picture viewers etc. if your phone is jailbreak your 90% there anyway. On modmyifone you will find a list of reputable sources to dl apps when you put installer on your iphone.
what an overpriced piece of trash, user interface is cool, but this device doesn't do alot. re; no video record, no voice activation, no file managment, unless I am missing something!
can somebody clarify for me what applications there actually are for the iphone...after jailbreaking it...jailbreaking your ï¿½1000 phone...



aren't they just really stupid apps like

puzzle games and stuff because seriously if it is like that then theres just no point.



are there ones which actually utilise the system and are helpful in any way?



if the answer is no then im just going to wreck the iphone even more
go to modmyifone.com. There are loads of guides if your havin problems


Can any one tell me.....will i be able to use the phone as a modem....so that i can surf internet on my laptop ......and will it be fast..
" other than the iphone, i said OTHER than the iphone, what other phones use multi touch because, although hypocritical the touch screen on this thing is far better than any other touchscreen ive used "



There is`nt and the viewty is hard to use like u say. Those scroll bars down the side of the screen where u have to use a stylus is terrible, I originally bought one hoping it would be every bit as usable as the iphone but its no where near. It went back after a day.



I think apple will have the patent on the multi touch and the flicky screen thing but im sure some of the big manafactures can get around that.



i got a iphone it is cool
Nice style, nice web side, but you know ? this is 2008 and 99% people using MMS, REGULAR BLUETOOTH, VIDEO RECORDING AND SHARING, FORWARD SMS, GPS, and more.Iphone missing all this, and that's why most people hate it..But i dont hate it, it is good, but missing allot of nice future's..I know they sold allot, but i heard there is big line for Return, and most people selling on ebay..Apple must add allot of futures and that time Iphone will be #1 phone for me...
Hey... I don't get why all of you guys say the iphone sucks... Besides the fact that it has no 3g, most of the other downfalls can be overcomed by applications downloadable into your phone through the app tap application by nullriver. And for the comment posted by realistics guy... Yes... I'm quite sure apple would be able to start a revolution... Being that the apple iphone has been voted the number 1 invention of 2007... Furthurmore... How can you compare the iphone with the razr... i mean... its been out since 2005... 100 million sold... Check your maths... according to Bloomberg...apple sold 700 000 phones on july 2... on a single weekend!!! Lets just say... apple will officially release the iphone in asia and all... up production... imagine. Furthurmore... the iphone is so underpriced... affordable to almost all.
iphone no good.
I bought one before christmas and was not told that the phone does not send multiple texts, nor does it forward texts. Seems I have signed a contract for 18 months that ties me to a phone that does not do the things I bought it for.

@ Joaquin

thanks dude. i coulda sworn i was very close.

maybe iphones r not sold LEGALLY in South America, but i've seen quite a few bro.

thanks though
other than the iphone, i said OTHER than the iphone, what other phones use multi touch because, although hypocritical the touch screen on this thing is far better than any other touchscreen ive used.



but yeah what else uses it? the normal touchscreen such as the one on the LG viewty is just too hard to use
mcozzb,



we cannot do this, they check IP's

but we can share information, choose your auction and let me know. i will start bid on it too



http://www.squareauction.com/C...ategoryID=27
legolas,



Thanks dude. Do what you said. How about to buy 1 membership and then share? What you say?
does anyone know when the iphone update 1.1.3 will be abailable??
hey mcozzb,

go to this site

http://www.squareauction.com/W....aspx?Page=1
these guys have a point. they make money on small admin fees. i recomend to buy their membership as it gives you abilty to sort, which is must have if you are serious about winning. buy the cheapest - bronze membership. i spent about 60 bucks on bidding before i got my iPhone. constantly do sort as it gives you overview of where others are.

i am planning to get their Apple 17'', He-he!

LOL! Must say i thought MAYBE JUST MAYBE the iPhone sites wouldnt be viewable by any other phone,well just used my N81's Safari Web browser got in to

http://iphonefanclub.com
and all i can say is WTF!!? I was expecting more interesting things in this site!!? Ah well, it remains as an over hyped 'dont'.
thanks for that nixon, that made a hell of a lot of sense
Since the electrical voltage in the middle east is 220V and on the adapter of the iphone it's written 110-220V so you can charge it wherever you are in the world
Anybody knows how to check version no. of i-Phone????
i want to ask about : if i got this phone from USA can i charge it in middle east , because of the voltage it is different ?? or i should got something and then charge it !?!
yup, superman is right
but this phone no 3gif the 2nd gen iphone has



-bluetooth worth having

-MMS (LOL)

-proper camera

-video recording (LOL)

-proper operating system

-HSDPA

-browser which can actually load something more than text and pictures

-radio (music phone?!)

-proper speakers

-a music store you can actually download from on the go (music phone!?!?)



then i might actually consider it!

Apple's 2nd phone, if it's alot better than the 1st , then more fortunate for people who want it that didn't buy the first one.
we all just have to wait for apple's second offering...
Hi, guys. can anyone tell me how to remove the restrciction to put country code b4 a number to save a number for a contac. i mean to say if i do not put country code i.e +91 here in india i am unable to see the name of the contact. this is not required in case of any nokia phones. for eg. if a save a number like 9822012345 for a person in iphone with a name xyz then while calling this number via dial pad it doesnt show the name xyz while calling. for that i hv to put the number as +91 9822012345. whts the solution ?
and when i buy a phone all i look out for is features really. novelty wears off a nice UI
cheers allan!



and yeah i always thought the ipod video had washed out colours so it isnt surprising that the ipod touch and iphone also suffer.



Nokia N95 8GB...$300, Sidekick LX...$200, Apple Iphone 8GB...$300, Nokia N81 8GB...$200
I-Phone and I-Pod Touch are pretty much the same rite?

Well then read this of your precious loosing in video and N95 winning:

http://symbianworld.wordpress....ouch-vs-psp/
Touchscreen i don't care about. 8gb has a larger screen.QWERTY would be nice, it is on the e90.
all this bickering makes me laugh! Both the n95 & the iPhone are great phones. But also neither one is perfect. The iPhone really is a slick bit of kit with an amazing interface which has definitly raised the bar,  but also has some serious delibertly designed sofware limitations (go find the cracks etc if you've got one), yes it should have  a better camera with a flash can't disagree there. The n95, well nokia definitly made a sweet phone, but where's the large touch screen & qwerty keyboard?



As with anything you buy work out want. Do your reasearch and get what's right for you!!





Timbrex. Can you download application's for a better camera or a flash. How about downloading an application for built in gps.
skwx



safari br0wsing is THE BEST, aint it!?? hell, its ALMOST even better than br0wsing on yer pc/lapt0p!!! lol. "other" cellph0nes dont even come CLOSE!!! ^_^





allan



s0metimes its not ALL AB0UT the FEATURES, h0mes!!! get 0ver it. al0t of iPhone users have. also, if y0u can aff0rd to buy an iPhone, why n0t spend an EXTRA $20 0r so t0 have it unl0cked and get the MOST out of it!?? that was a "rhet0rical" question by the way, y0u dont have to answer it.



i unl0cked my iPhone f0r FREE using guides on the 'net s0 i dont think thats even an ISSUE.
When you have to send your iphone in to apple to get the battery replaced do you think apple will send you another iphone in the meantime while your battery get's replaced. I think not!
How about how other cell phone's are coming out with 5 meg camera's and gps and good quality music player's that you can actually hear, of course they all have the basic bluetooth transfer except , well the iphone. All these other cell phone's you don't have to pay to get them unlocked, plus replacable battery's.
New features for iPhone will come at Macworld on Tuesday, as for call quality my  iPhone is crystal clear at both ends of the conversation.



The only thing I agree with is that it is hard to hear calls in loud environments. But then I keep mine in a case in my pocket which probably muffles the sound more than if it was just in my pocket.
Lol does everyone find it funny how LG, Samsung, and especially iRiver have completed copied the iPhone design. they haven't even tried to hide it. They all look exactly the same with the one button for home, just made with cheap materials
Iphone techology is years ahead of anything, and it's only going to get better with all the new udates. For those having problems, you just havn't downloaded the right apps yet.

It's potential is beyond anything else.

I love this phone. I got rid of my HTC TyTNII and bought this one. Not for a second I regreted it. Safari is way better than WM. It's much thinner, ways a lot less and much more practical in use. You don't need a manual of 280 pages. Ok, it doesn't have GPS which is a shame, but than again I only need it at the end of my journey. Iphone has google maps and that works for me.
can any user of iphone tell me if i can use my old sim card(Jawwal) in my iphone, or should i use the sim card that comes with the iphone.

where can i get SMSD for my IPHONE??I must say when the iphone came out, I liked the looks of it but hated all the missing features. such as voice dial, mms, etc. we all know whats not there. But now it's time for me to get a new phone & my needs have changed a bit. So I came here did a phone finder just to see. Every phone was a windows mobile device, except for the iphone. I personally & many others don't need all the extra features crammed in to a phone. So for many including myself the iphone makes sense.  I will never by a symbian base phone there junk. I am by no means an apple fan at all. But the iphone has what I need so thats my next phone. Unless someone can point me to a quadband, with wifi, & can hold at least 8gb space for 400.00 or less. & yes I want touchscreen.
Some of you are numpties, a lot of people with s60 phones like to use Opera Mini to Google and Opera Mini DOESNT report what OS its running on, yet i-Phone doesnt support Java and its users CAN ONLY use the built-in Safari Browser giving Apple the advantage to get these results, Symbian Freak actualy pointd that out and a few other real facts like Nokia being the 1st to have full web browsing 2YEARS AGO.
for starters every body knows that nokia has major software defects evry one of them after a little while goes cold turkey. i mean if one fone can offer you more than just a cam, and drop and drag well i wana have it, even down here in south africa im getting an iphone man. th price that is just rite not a costly software problem N95 the NO series is not for me. I rocks
And wayne aren't mobiles supost to be light small and eazy to put in your  pocket? well my opinion is that the i phone doesn't stand to that is just a big thin touch tv for me.
allan you are right i am with you man this is what i tell every one but they think that having the i phone  they will actualy get the best thing on the market but they never asked about all the things you said.I AM WITH YOU NOKIA N95 ROCKS compair to the i phone
allan:

I have the N95 8GB and my gf just got herself an iphone (thats why I'm reading these treads..)

yeah yeah N95 spec is far more better than the iphone...

but no one can beats the huge touch screen!! and the UI is impressive.

but yeah adding in music is kind of pain in the ass... I hate itunes and you cant drag and drop with iphone (can do with ipod touch)

finally the price... N95 8GB - HKD6188 (USD700 with tax)

iphone - USD 399 plus tax plus turbo sim (HKD 250 in Hong Kong, USD 65 in the US)
bgj7. Don't you mean without bluetooth transfer, a2dp, and without a good camera and without auto focus and a flash and no volume and having to pay to unlock and without voice dialing and without gps. Oh yeah can't wait to get iphone, not!!  n95 rule's!!!!!!!!!!
i don't thing there is something special about the i phone.Infact i thing that the touch screen makes it even more difficult to use
@momonhbk,

That's why you post it twice - you are indeed using a NOKIA 7710.
@Savor,

I love the iPhone. and yes, i love how it flashes compared to other boring regular phones that one would not be able to distinguish between from a distance of more than 4 meters. where as the iphone, it's eye-catching. and i dont care if it doesnt have all the functions n95 has, it is sooo much nicer to use. it's elegance catches anyone attention, and once u start using it u never want to go back to ur old buttoned phones. and yes, i am a young adult. however, the funny thing is that probably 70% of purchases of such electronic devices are by people of my age! hoah! macworld!
Five million kids that love only the design and are the number one surfers on Google

Lots of kids........



Five million Iphones out there and growing.......
Nokia fanboys no comment about the fact that the Iphone is the NUMBER one mobile device on Google eh ?

Facts of life are much harder to digest than your Bull ......

Tomorrow is Macworld in SF , get ready for additional hard facts to digest

keep quiet !!!!!!

Ah ah



I love the Apple fanboy who said LG was trying to copy the iPhone's design. Here's a history lesson for you. LG Prada won a design award in 2006. Months before iPhone was even released. iPhone really is for kids who love the flash and nothing else after the honeymoon period is over.
i really cant wait till i get my i-phone



getting tyred of my old phone..



gio, l.0.v.e y.a.
this fone good.
how  about sega games in nokia 7710 , i have it ...,  nothing beat the viewing pleasure of its web browser, i'm posting this comment using my 7710.
rock you have to admit it was stupid leaving out flash. Thats basic functionality.



but using the safari browser is neat.



With 3G it would be that little bit more awesome.



and NES? why should i know that?! Nintendo have never made a serious console and never made any serious games. Yep, playstation fan here
hahaha! w0rd up, h0mes!!!



this is y i sed when surfing the 'net 0n the iPh0ne... NOTHING comes close!!!



yup yup! ^_^
no bluetooth no this no that,but it made  number one on google surfng !!!!!!!!!hi rock



thanks a lot. i had been in a debate with you about this ifone vs n95 8gb, that it's not good. however, i am now little convinced , it's ok. but lacks a lot of feature. however i am happy.

peepaz



hahaha! true. AL0T of the "new" ph0nes n0wadayz l00k AL0T like the iPh0ne!!! alth0ugh true that they have M0RE/BETTER FEATURES u'd think that they can c0me up with their 0WN ideas, nahmsayin??? hahaha! w3rd.



c0incidentally, veriz0ns "v0yager" l00ks m0re like an iCl0ne rather than an iPh0ne killer!!! l0l.
girly girl



hey, s0 u g0t it!?!?! COOL! s0 give us a review, yeah??? l0l. hey, ill send you an email pr0lly by t0m or s0. ayt???
heey,



finally got my i-phone...



i love it!!



r 0 c k, check your pm please
alth0ugh i HAVE seen iPh0nes whos batterys were SH0T w/in its FIRST YEAR 0f use and yes, that d0es SUCK cuz itz an INTERNAL battery & replacing it requires s0ldering so u have t0 be s0mewhat "technical" if u want t0 fix ur 0wn ph0ne.



VERY RARE that ive seen this th0 and u can just BUY "replacement" batts 0n eBay f0r $15. alth0ugh still an "inc0nvenience" f0r the user if this happens. but again, very rare. and als0, an inc0nvenience.
DUDES!!!



this tw0-year battery thing IS true!!! just like 0n ANY cellph0ne(im pretty sure m0st of y0u have similar exp. t0 this) the battery starts g0ing to bits AFTER the 2 year mark. the iPh0ne was RELEASED june '07 so ALL 0f the iPh0nes are n0t even HALFWAY there yet!!! even if it gets s0ld to the sec0nd user they sh0uld still have a g00d YEAR left(or s0) of use and by the time the 2 year mark f0r the iPh0ne is up(since the BEGINNING), the iPhone 2'll be 0ut anyways s0 what's the big deal???
What i saw was a flimpsy, easy to snap in half pc that will overheat within a short period. It is obvious 2 me that time ran out on jobs and he was forced 2 leave out d dvd drive. Maybe he wanted a blu ray or hd drive but hadnt the time. ï¿½1200 with 80GB wtf, wtf! Get a life apple. 2 add d screen was copied from d vaio NR series, proof that they copy their designs, just like d iphone. Any pc wit wifi can use another pc's cd drive- just need 2 share it, wtf.lonestar thats pretty useful because super doesnt work on vista. Ill take that off you if you dont mind and i highly appreciate that :)
to rock,



how r u? w/o connectiong my phone with pc, when i press installer button, it first says 113 is not yet jail broken. what does it mean? i am afraid. i got my fone from Bangkok (bang-your-cock at bangkok) and the person was not sure whether it was previously unlocked or not. should i proceed.
@ nick

another gud converter is Xilsoft 3GP Video Converter. like Super, it converts anything, and i mean ANYTHING even DVD formats. u can even cut songs/videos and I got a Registration Code & Name if u need it.
jjle



what d0 u expect h0mes he's a n0kia user! l0l. im just playin br0 wh0ever it was wh0 said that u use whatever ph0ne u like, nahmsayin??? ^_^
love-iphone



thats weird if u cann0t c0nnect t0 iTunes! it d0esnt matter if ur iPh0ne is unl0cked 0r n0t u SH0ULD be able t0 c0nnect either way!



i have iTunes v7.4(w/c is kinda 0ld cuz theres 7.6 n0w) but ive never had a pr0blem c0nnecting with it! try "uninstalling" then reinstalling either y0ur current iTunes/7.6/7.4 and see if that w0rks!
a good movie converter is super. just search super on google and its the first link. converts anything to anything
borey



afaik the iPh0ne can 0nly open .PDF files. theres a 3rd party app that d0es that. ^_^ alth0ugh i never had a chance t0 check 0ut th0se "ms" files yet. l0l. maybe the 0ther iPh0ne users can help u 0ut 0ver here!
edwin



my bad, h0mes! my bad... i guess i just had a little t00 much fun last night after all it was a SATURDAY, nahmsayin!?? ^_~ l0l.



the iPh0ne IS a pretty c00l gadget, aint it???



ok, in resp0nse t0 ur q's:



1. sa60 already menti0ned syncing ur c0ntacts t0 "0utl00k" then sync it with iTunes/iPh0ne. this is c0rrect(thanks sa60!). but there is an0ther way t0 c0py ur simcard c0ntacts DIRECTLY t0 ur iPhone! i d0nt kn0w if u have an "unl0cked" iPh0ne but there is a 3rd party app called "iSIM" w/c lets u d0 just that!



if ur iPh0ne is l0cked t0 at&t then u have t0 d0 it like sa60 said. 0r u can als0 d0 it MANUALLY. w/c really sucks esp if u have AL0T 0f c0ntacts!!! l0l.



2. u have t0 c0nvert ur m0vies t0 .mp4 f0rmat s0 u can watch them thr0ugh ur iPh0ne! theres l0ts 0f c0nverters 0nline sa60 menti0ned 0ne already(thanks again, h0mes!) then u just need to transfer that file t0 the "m0vies" secti0n in iTunes, sync, D0NE!!!



cheers! ^_^
sa60



ps. if its n0t "unl0cked" 0riginally, then u sh0uld be able t0 upgrade t0 113. like, say f0r ex. if it was 0RIGINALLY 112(0ut 0f the b0x). i w0udlnt rec0mmend upgrading t0 113 if it was 111 PREVI0USLY due t0 the reas0ns i menti0ned bel0w.
sa60



glad t0 hear ur n0w able t0 transfer vids with n0 pr0bs! ^_^ just make sure y0u check ALL videos w/c u need transferred N0T just the "newest" 0ne cuz iTunes "deletes" all th0se that are unchecked.



d0nt w0rry abt that "installer" message! it just says N0T to update t0 v113 0therwise y0u'll l0se ALL ur 3rd party appz!!! afaik, v113 is currently N0T unl0ckable.



u REALLY d0nt need t0 upgrade t0 v113 cuz "installer" has ALL the 3rd party appz Y0U'LL EVER NEED(u'll l0se it if u upgrade) and PLUS, ur g0nna REL0CK ur ph0ne if y0u d0!!!
kevin



s0rry about that. i d0nt think any0ne here kn0ws any pers0nalized iPod accs! just d0 a g00gle search and a c0uple 0f them sh0uld p0p up!

4)does the bluetooth connection in iphone connect to an other iphone only?



PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE TELL ME THE ANSWERS.IM REALLY CURIOUS.
CRAIG

hi just look the products from Dell and apple they will never let the customers of their products a free walk with their products.The victims (of their products) free will is ruled by the marketing and management tricks of these companies .But compare the products of Sony ,Nokia,Samsung,LG,Hp etc and just think  for a couple of minutes and come to conclusion. I am EEE(IIT) and MBA from (Harvard)
hi guys... people are obsessed with the looks and the hype that created by the media . Apple is a good in marketing they proved it once again.After a year will see the iphone in the thrash.
Thanks alot rock!!

d0nt w0rry abt the installer! if u upgrade it, thats fine. just d0nt upgrade ur f/w via iTunes unless u want a BRICKED iPh0ne! l0l.wow 2mg pix camera no 3g....come on apple the LG viewty if it has WLAN ill buy it better than ipone heck....ill buy the viewty i already have internet at home dont really use my phone as a internet so ill go with LG Viewty...comparing the too the LG is much better check it out guys compare the 2....
do you think that quad band iphone can work on  tri band net work?please reply urgently
The phone is exactly what I expected and MORE!  I saw a couple of posts about not being able to connect to iTunes, you need to be on a wi-fi network...it's in the documentation.  But, it's excellent and is so much better than any 'phone' I've had before.  Apple, keep up the good work.
i told you so..ipod touch is much better. just get a separate phone and you'll be fine
Is this Phone the Bomb? or is it Over-rated can someone who actually owns one please tell me..........?
r 0 c k

no still can't connect.

i have ipod touch and i connect to my comuputer but my iphone? mmmm f*ck cannot connect.

i think i can't use the iBricker too cause how i can send if when i connect my iphone to comp my comp just error?

sa60



my problem is when my iphone i connect to computer after second my computer off and my computer say there problem
It is nice but not completely can be used  in Malaysia yet.I as a Malaysian faces a bit of difficulties of using iPhone. Somehow, I just love the iPhone. With the quality and many more.
This is just a show-off gadget.

A phone without bluetooth data transfer is as useless as a rotten vegetable.



W960i is a much better phone.
The greatest thing I ever bought, let alone a phone. So glad I dumped my Pocket PC phone.

Can't wait for the next one.
if ur going to get any touch phone you may as well get this one because its the only one with multi touch. Tbh the other touchscreens out there are poor in comparison.



does apple own the rights to multi touch or something?
yeah well, i like it soo..

ifone-lover



i find no other reasons for ur prob. scan ur pc with with any other antivirus. Norton is no good, may be AVG 7.5, also intall and scan spyware terminator (it's free). also install wincare. if the prob is not solved, format ur pc and install winxp with sp2. install itunes7.6. at last if all these are solving ur prob , reset ur iphone and try with ur fresh pc.

i had been and still a nokia lover. i initially did not like this ifone. had lot of debates with many spl with rock. but now i am convinced it's no less productive a fone than any brand. it was the first venture of apple; as such may not have taken a lot of things into consideration. hopefully ifone2 will overcome all those limitations and come out soon with a lot of features. i will request all ifone user to browse www.blog.psmxy.org and find the possibilities of installing all new features into ur ifone. u will be surprised. nokia, now, is not at all a match with the features of iphone. rather symbian software will take years to compete OS X or windows based cell phones.



when i bought iphone a week before, i was frustrated to see the small numbers of features in the fone, after installing a good numbers of freeware, i am more than happy. if u r an internet browser, then go for it.
oh yeah r0ck, what phone do you own now?



just curious
nice raw

do not like it.looks nice, great toy, but no mobile as we expect of the product of the year.Sure if brands as Nokia, SE , Samsung are willing....they blow away iphone from the market

l just want to say 1 thing that phone has less features than N95 8gb but the performance of te phone amazing.it never freeze like the other Symbians.SE Pseries were better for symbian than Nokia but they freeze and l dont like that.This phone works perfect it is simple but functional.lm not idiot to lose my way.l dont need navigation.How the old people says.lf you ll go on asking,the city BAGDAT wont be far away.The best screen and l like to look the screen,if it isnt strong,then l dont care 5 or10Mpix camera.2 is enough with the best screen the photos are great,and also for surfing the phone is perfect.New generation software is perfect.everyday Apple ll make it better.THNXS TO APPLE.
Someone told me that you can not delete a text message or call you sent only all recent calls ar text messages!! You can not select specific ones!! Is that true?
i know the iphone has wireless right, but like can u go through the device wirelessly from a PC using the same connection?
What the f**k?!



No real bluetooth, no custom rigntones nor alerts of any kind, no draft message box??



This is an Ipod with a phone, if you want a phone, look elsewhere, and if you like its eyecandy tricks, buy the Ipod Touch.



Cheers,



Vicky

l0ve-iPh0ne



were u able t0 get ur pr0blem fixed???
sa60



u d0 n0t have t0 spend anything EXTRA when ur iPh0ne c0nnects t0 the internet pr0vided u ALREADY have an established wifi c0nnecti0n either @ ur h0use/w0rk!



if u have wifi there, u can c0nnect AS MANY devices as u please and ur c0st w0uld be the same!!! l0l.



just g0 t0 ur iPh0nes settings, then general, then u sh0uld see a setting t0 set ur wifi click 0n that, and d0 scan, and y0ull have t0 pr0vide ur WEP key(passw0rd) t0 share the same internet c0nnecti0n & v0ila! d0ne. i c0uld be a little 0ff 0n s0me 0f the steps there but thats genereally h0w it g0es i just cant check F0R SURE cuz i already s0ld my iPh0ne!!! l0l.
U can copy ur contacts from sim to phone..just install the software isim i guess  from its installer !didi



yer welc0me. ^_^



yup! updating it T0TALLY up t0 you! iTunes will ALWAYS give u a "c0nfirmation" message if u want t0 update 0r n0t. as l0ng as u keep 0n pressing "n0", u'll never update!



sure. if u buy s0ngs from iTunes i d0nt see why u sh0uldnt be able t0 sync it w/ ur iPh0ne. theres an applicati0n called installer 0n unl0cked phones which lets u d/l games/themes/wallpapers/s0unds DIRECTLY t0 the ph0ne!!! neat, huh???
when i got my iphone a couple of weeks back, i have given rest to my htc touch and now hiding in my briefcase. it's also a nice looking fone, only 99.9 mm length.
rock



u get everything at pda4x. did u try "spb mobile shell". try pointui. beautiful. i tried the one u asked in my htc touch and workrd well. i mean screen lock.
r 0 c k

thank u sooo much for ur help...one last question hehehe....so i can never update it?....and are there any themes i can install or games?...and if i use itunes and i dont upgrade i can put songs on it right?....and if i need to buy the games or themes from itunes will i be able to install them since its unlocked?
i already have wm6PRO 0n my wing, h0mes! haha!



i checked 0ut that site & DAMN theres al0t 0f sw appz f0r my wing... ^_^ ill be sure t0 spend sum "quality time" there f0r the next c0upla days!



hey, u kn0 where i can get an app similar t0 the iPh0nes l0ck screen???
sa60



d0pod m700??? yeah... thats nice t00! ayt, ill check 0ut that s/w 0ne 0f these days as s00n as im d0ne messin ar0und wit my wing!



iPh0ne is a killer-l00king device everytime i pull it 0ut i get c0mpliments 0n it! ^_^



upgrade t0 v113? N0. 0ther than the fact that u'll rel0ck ur ph0ne u als0 l0se the installer app w/c is what makes the iPh0ne S0 MUCH FUN!!!
rock



browse www.pda4x.com and go to pocket pc section of released application applications, u will find thousands of software with which u can turn ur wm5 fone into a wm6 phone.
rock,



i spoiled my dopod m700 by just adding one after another software. wm5 fone can always be turned in to a wm6-look phone. i still have htc touch (touch flow) with me and giving a look of the applications (screen) like an ifone. try a software "pointui" for ur fone (it works well with htc touch) and will get a feelings of ifone applications. what should matter to me is the design and look of a phone that i would carry.



apple looks good and stylish. it had so many limitations initially, but now anthing can be done with it.



pls tell me now, can i upgrade my fone to 1.1.3 ?? though 1.1.1 is very stable. i have installed more than 100 software and it never faultered. what do u think???

didi



if its unl0cked & u update tru iTunes U WILL L0CK THE PH0NE!!! when that update c0mes up u c0uld always say N0 t0 it and keep ur current/unl0cked state. ^_^
sa60



nah man... hahaha! ive hard SPL'ed & installed t0uchfl0 on it and thats wm6!!! l0l. s0 many 0ptions... DAMN! a full keyb0ard is g00d f0r me s0 im tryna see if this is s0mewhat usable!



ive had the tytn b4 but i d0nt wanna g0 f0r the 2 cuz its RIDICUL0USLY expensive and is alm0st the same as the 0rig! l0l.
r 0 c k

thanks for ur info...but if its unlocked and i want to upgrade the phone..will it lock? how can i prevent that from happening? would i not be able to upgrade the phone?
iphone love



how did u configure ur itune setting. is it automatioc on connection of ur fone or u do it manually?
hey,can somebody tells me how to reset the iphone ?i need to reset it,and what should i do if "my bro randomly pressed my  pass"  and it said my iphone has been disabled.  and need passcode,i dont know what passcode it asked for.

u r using p4350!!!!!!!!! ???? it's a WM5 platform fone. how could go back to an older version after using iphone!!!!!!! surprising. hah! should have started with htc tytnII.
iphone-love



strange!!! what rock says?? i am using 1.1.1 ver. if u have upgraded, u may have to configure ur fone for internet with ur service provider apn again to see "E". i think u know how to do it. i am not expert in upgrading the ifone , as such i do not want to take any risk. go to trouble shooting of this fone in its manual.
This Fone rocks, my aouzin is a Mac fan,and this will complete his set of apple family, i think if he is rich, hell get one of these,, LoL

i try so many ways (not yet with other pc) to connect to itunes but still same.

do i miss something to install when i update from 1.0.2 to 1.1.2? cause now in near signal i dont see text E (EDGE)i just see box but empty wat in 1.0.2 was text E how or maybe i have to update again?

well u see a "l0cked" iPh0ne 0NLY w0rks w/ a certain pr0vider(here in the u.s. its at&t) whereas an UNL0CKED 0ne u c0uld use w/ ANY GSM prov. u want! als0, "unl0cked" iPh0nes are als0 jailbr0ken meaning its 0pen t0 ANY & ALL 3rd party applicati0ns 0ut there!!!Look out apple and step aside cause here come's the Garmin Nuvifone. It look's awesome! GPS and cell phone with a camera and video recording and web browsing maybe it's wifi! Also mp3 player! When this hit's the market it will be a BIG seller!!!!!!!!
its a ultimate crash...carziest phone i have eer seen.wht do ppl see in this ....oh my god such a waste of money.this phone hangs,is slow and just not worth it.apple pls dont try to imitate............
is a great mobile, but with the tools and interface is very hard to use when transfer information like mp3, the touch screen is wonderfull, id like to purchase one but is very expensive
hey rock



yesterday i downloaded GBs of software from my fone connected with my pc via wifi. that was my first connection. i had to initially put a PW for getting into it. today i can see that my fone is connected via wifi, but unable to connect with the host. i tried all out but failed. fone is , downloaded vis EDGE, no prob. in the netwk page of the fone, i can see the password (PW) icon, but no way to open n put the icon. any suggestion.
Meaning of hacking



A Hack is usually a technique used to subvert, misuse or subtly change a program, gadget or mechanism in such a way as to change, or add to, its functionality.



Hack has several meanings in the technology and computer science fields: a clever or quick fix to a computer program problem; a clumsy or inelegant solution to a problem; or a modification of a program or device to give the user access to features that were otherwise unavailable to them.

I hated this cell when it first came out because I was such a huge Nokia fan. I'm starting to see the appeal of this and I will get my iphone in a few days. Its build quality is much better than my N95.

For a company to build a phone this good for the first time the second phone will blow everything away.
The Turbo SIM (also known as TurboSIM) was introduced in December 1, 2004 by BLADOX, located in Prague, Czech Republic. It is a very thin device with a 9mm by 9mm eeprom mounted in the top right corner. It has the makers name BLADOX in gold letters on its black PCB. It is pressed on top of a normal SIM card (with some plastic cut off) in such a way that it is still small enough to be inserted into the SIM card slot of any GSM phone. Without the product, the SIM card is still usable as before. The Turbo SIM works with any GSM mobile phone produced since 1998, adding in new functionality like larger SMS archives.[1]



The Turbo SIM also has the ability to unlock the iPhone[2][3], allowing the usage of other mobile operators other than AT&T or O2 etc. in the iPhone. This can be done as the Turbo SIM tricks the iPhone into believing that it is operating on the original carriers network even though it is connected natively (not in roaming mode) on another mobile operator. It does this by copying the IMSI and ICCID number of the original SIM shipped with the iPhone be it AT&T, O2, etc. so when the iPhone asks for the original SIM's ID, Turbo SIM gives it them instead of the the iD of the SIM currently in the tray. This means that the iPhone can update the latest firmware from Apple's server.



sa60

what mean back up system?

i try to download winxp sp2 than they say before i install i have to back up system first.

or it mean foto,music .....
sa60

is the turboSIM is the thing what is connect with sim card like what i have?
hal



all are same/similar process of unlocking an ifone and updating to a newer firmware
hi sa60



thats what i thought, 750USD is really abit too much.

but i just want to make sure, if i buy the f/w 1.1.2 with turbosim and jailbreak myself.

will i be able to install 3rd party apps?

if jailbreak=unlocking, then the 200USD for the unlocking process seems abit too much



thx for the fast reply!
hal,



if u wanna play with ur fone or want to upgrade to 113, then u should learn all these things. otherwise just buy an unlocked phone and enjoy installing new softwares compatible with 112.



price seems to be little high.unlocked fone should cost about max 700 $ and a locked one no more than 400 $. be sure to know the memory, 4 or 8 gb. should buy a 8gb fone
Hi Rock or sa60



have something i want to ask.

im almost going to buy an iphone here in hong kong. the guy told me it would cost USD560 for an iphone (f/w 1.1.2) with turbosim.

then he said, that its not unlocked. and if i want him to unlock it, it will cost USD750.

wts all the difference between unlocked/turbosim/bricked/jailbreak

ive been reading on many websites about jailbreaking. is jailbreaking the way to unlock the iphone?

thx in advance
i know, its a revolution isnt it
i have been working for a call centre ,i rarely hear that any customer is satisfied totally with this gadget...........
sa60

i just want to find out why i can't connect to comp. i used orange provider N when i have why must used extra thing in sim card N they say i have new version and all new version of iphone need extra thing in simcard is that true? is so pity i have so nice mobile but i can't used perfectly
hi

i still p0st up fr0m time t0 time just t0 say wuzzup nahmsayin??? w3rd.
i love this phone ,,, gonna buy one sooooooooon ...
iphone love



what was your question. however whatever i remember, if u r not using at&t simcard, then u may have to configure again, cus on upgrade it refreshes ur some of/all the setting.



in setting, go to general, find network, find apn tab and write the one of your service provider including ur username and password.



i use different simcard, to get into internet, i use thr apn, for example at apn i write gpinternet, or gpmms, or gpwap.



u may also contact ur service provider.



i am again afraid, as u have upgraded, something might have gone wrong
iPhone allows you to make a callRock. Vibration on the iphone. The same guy who said his iphone wasn't loud enough also said the vibration didn't help either. Vibration eh rock well i guess that pretty much take's care of call identifier on the iphone if you downloaded a song to a person's phone number.
Rock you even admitted that the battery on the iphone is a pain because you have to send it in after a year. Look how girly girl even had problem's with her iphone!!
Rock. Let's talk about Fact's. Mobile review. com stated from the test they did that the n95 has more talk time than the iphone!
Rock if i had your iphone you would have to pay me to try it out!!
I don't have hate for it, all i'm saying is you contradicted yourself. You sound like you hate the n95! Anyway's this new garmin phone with gps, wi fi, 3g, camera, video recording, mp3 will make it very hard on apple's iphone sale's unless apple compete's agains't it with a new iphone!
y u g0t s0 much h8 fer the iPh0ne, br0! n0b0dy's f0rcing u ta buy 0ne, u kn0w???



l0l.
"Rock, if people turn down the volume on the iphone 1 little bit it will be muted."



are u even SERI0US??? h0w can u make such 0utlandish claims? have u ever 0wned 0ne???



"What about all those missed call's people experience on the iphone because it's not loud enough."



0ne w3rd h0mes. vibrate.



"Why don't you just admit that the battery on the iphone is no better than the n95!"



i never said the iPh0nes batt was better! wh0 cares abt that??? allz i said is that ur ph0nes batt dies FASTER!!! this is a FACT, h0mes.



"Are you defending the iphone still a phone you don't even own anymore! Such a great phone this iphone eh! That must be why you sold it!"



yep. it IS a great ph0ne! yep. s0ld it after 3 m0nths. and my n95-2 u say??? g0t b0red & s0ld it after TWO WEEKS!!! s0 whats ur p0int???



i had an n95 8gb vs ur n95 and i was easily BORED with mine. hell, if i had ur n95 id pr0lly have s0ld it in TWO DAYS!!! l0lz.
Rock. You said you are not knockin any phone's battery capacity, but in the same posting you said the n95 battery suck's! You are contradicting yourself!!
Rock, if people turn down the volume on the iphone 1 little bit it will be muted. What about all those missed call's people experience on the iphone because it's not loud enough. I could however listen to my music at 40 or 50 percent and still be louder than the iphone's mp3.  An iphone user even said once that downloading that amp thing for the iphone still didn't make it loud enough!!
Rock. I'm proud that my battery on my n95 isn't soldered in, like on the iphone! Why don't you just admit that the battery on the iphone is no better than the n95! Are you defending the iphone still a phone you don't even own anymore! Such a great phone this iphone eh! That must be why you sold it!
btw, i ment the actual "ph0ne" functi0n like, wen u have t0 make a call! l0l.
Love-IPhone



well, u can STILL use v.112 iPh0nes! surf the web, iP0d/mp3 player, d/l appz, utube, weather, st0cks, maps, etc. just cant use the ph0ne functi0ns is all! l0lz.



v.112 iPh0nes need turb0 fer that!
allan



im n0t kn0ckin' any ph0nes batt capacity. allz im sayin is FACT. thats basically why ur s0 pr0ud carrying 2 BATTS wit ya all the time!!! l0l.



admit it, n95 battery life sucks. maybe u sh0uld turn d0wn ur ph0nes v0lume s0 u c0uld c0nserve ur batt life a little! l0l.
hal



yep! the "installer" file can be f0und on the main screen 0n the iPh0ne. ya cant miss it, its g0nna stick 0ut like a s0re thumb! l0l.
hey guys. I'd just like to know if anybody here has an iPhone or tested one. I want to buy it buy I heard that the battery isn't so good. Is that true ?? How long can I talk without charging ?? And should I take this one or another ?? THX for your help
armani looks nice, but very limited possibilities of adding extra softwares
r0ck



i got my connection alright. working fine. i had to call my ISP to do that
sa60 / r 0 c k



so that mean i can't used the iphone without turbosim?
Rock. I have the advantage. Someone using the iphone for 2hrs staight differant feature's and myself using my n95 differant feature's 2hrs straight. If both phone's get to low i can still use my n95 and walk around you see i picked up a spare battery for 40 buck's, which was a good price. i alway's keep spare one charged but i don't need it all the time. I rotate the battery's from time to time. Back to my point. After the iphone is to low you are tied to a plug with it! Everyone know's you can't change the iphone battery duh!!
Rock. This is what my point was DUH!! Talk for 40 min. on the iphone and watch that battery drop. I'm also a cellphone junkie, but i keep them alot longer than 3 month's. Can't afford to alway's be buying new one's.rock



a number of 111 softwares have upgraded to 113. what u r doing about it. can u feed ur forgotten iphone. among all the developers, "ste" was the best. abt 90% softwares are upgraded to 113. stupid. how 111 user will donate now?????
edge is abt the same as gprs when it c0mes t0 battery c0nsumption w/c is really n0t that much esp. c0mpared t0 3G(w/c the iPh0ne thankfully d0esnt have l0l) 0r wifi.



hey g00d deal btw 0n ur unl0cked + jailbr0ken iPh0ne. n0t t00 bad, h0mie! ^_^
ohhh ok ill try and turn the EDGE of tonite. doesnt it consume ur battery?

hope they have a software unlock in near future. coz apparantly they say its almost impossible to do it. and btw

the shops here, also selling unlocked 1.1.2 but they went the hardware disassemble way. only adding 60USD to it. but i rather stick to a new iphone. and if i wanna sell it. i just ask them to disassemble it for me and unlock it :P

ah s0 thats h0w they d0 it wit turb0! ^_^ n0t bad... its a g00d w0rkar0und until they can find a TRUE unl0ck s0lution fer v.112/113 iPh0nes!



is that right? they g0t a new v. fer gpsphone? DAMN! they c0me up wit new updates REAL QUICK!!!



the edge ic0n sh0uldnt affect ur iPh0ne in any way, h0mes! alth0 u can install openSSH t0 disable edge, wifi, ssh, etc. if it bugs ya that much! l0l.
hmmm r 0 c k

i always have the E for edge on top of my iphone.

is there a way to turn that off? i dont have edge on my network i think.
yah, that gpsphone is the gamboy advance emulator.

but they have a new version 1.2 and should fix most issues

loads of gameboy advance roms to download. i just wanna play mario kart on it lol

i installed the NES rom. but not many games i like there :S
gpsphone thingy? i think thats the gameb0y emu is it n0t??? u can try d/l'ing it but its pretty useless in my opini0n cuz i d0nt w0rk if u d0nt have gameb0y R0MS ta run it with!!!



its in beta ver. t00 i believe meaning u g0t n0 s0und 0r sum schnazz like that! l0l.
r 0 c k

about the sim. they did it for me ;)

its just the corner they cut it. u can still put it in any other phone.

then they tend to "glue" or tape that turbo sim with my simcard. and thats it

that turbosim thingy is just a very thing sheet with some bobbles on it lol
ohhh ic r 0 c k

thats why, after a while, that app is suddenly on my main screen lol.

now im trying to figure out, how to install the gpsphone thingy. thats really tricky.

i have to do coding >.
< change permission using winscp or sth.. and i have to wait till i get home to do it.

coz at work, all sites get blocked :S cant do any research
hal



g00d deal, h0mes! u g0nna get used ta d UI in N0 TIME!!! ^_^



ey, s0 did ya cut up yer sim? h0ws it d0ne im kinda curi0us...



it c0uld be as PS9Q says 0r u can try re-d/l'ng a c0upla times cuz it happend t0 me, t00!



server time-0uts, n0 space, yadda-yadda, but in the end i still g0t my app th0! l0l.
ohh i see!! thx for the info!!

hai



the one u r trying to dnld ,is not for 112, it is for 113. at times it does not say the version. for example, try from ste repository, u wont be able to doso.
r0ck



pls guide me. i need n have to upgrade to 113.i cannot wait. i need the dict and thesaurus badly.
r 0 c k



finally got my iphone ;), bought the 1.1.2 one, and yea it was jailbroken.

so far so good with it, just need to get used to it, coz its a total new UI compared to traditional mobile phones.

but got a question. how come sometimes when im in "installer" and i install apps, it says. "error downloading package" is it coz i got timed out or sth?
Abdu Dodo



you just select all the days, after you confirm you should see everyday.

i have alarms mon-fri, and after selecting them and going back. i see alarms set for "weekdays". you dont get the seperate function of "everyday" like in SE phones.



hope it helps u
hot hot hot hot hot i so want thos phone its AWESOME
r0ck



me /sa600 are same.i am annoyed with "ste". i wanted to free up some mem of my fone. it is left with only 20 mb of 300 mb. after freeing up,i wnated to install the same prog, but alas! but found all have been upgraded to 113, spl eng dict. where do i find those free for 111.
How do i set the alarm clock to sound daily at a particular time. I have checked the repeat settings but says every monday or tuesday and so on and so forth but not daily.
i am interested in this phone, but the Bluetooth spec says (v2.0, headset support only) i need this function for connecting with my cars Bluetooth, i have tried many phones nokia 9300i, e61, n73, and sony eric san p990, m600, motorola  razar, a1200ming.  all dont keep the connection for more than 15 minuets then disconnect.  the only one to work was htc touch i dont like the phone that much but it connects.  so i go back to my question on the apple iphone would any of you know that about this phone. thanks in advance.
if anyone is using the 3rd party apps from installer I wouldn't recommend upgrading to 1.1.3 firmware. If you do the majority of 3rd party apps won't work, I upgraded but then went back to 1.1.2the king of all fones is the ifone the greatest fone ever made after motorola apple is the name comes to my mind. turely coolest fone ever.
if you dont use 3g, then i guess ur not a heavy user of the whole browser thing aye?
Geez... when will you guys ever get over the FM thingy?



I've never used any device to listen to FM in my whole life? So I guess I am an outcast then... I must be missing out a helluva my life.



I don't use GPS ever and 3G and Video Call...



Ah.... shoot me...

yesterday i try to connect my iphone with other pc and oh! is working.

so why i can't connect my iphone to my pc?

even i've been update my pc still not working
here come's the garmin nuvifone. Apple will lose sales unless they offer 3g and built in gps !!
m@t2



I know why don't you tell us what phone u have and us iPhone owners will see if we can find 5 downsides to your phone ok
lol - no doubt a plastic n95 owner i presume



Who cares about an fm radio, only a 2mp cam, no a2dp, it says in the specs what it has and what it doesnt, u dont buy this phone if you want a 5mp cam, radio etc, all down to common sence, just like if u want a touch screen phone u dont buy a nokia n95!



As for downloading files come on, its a phone not a pc, wouldnt take long to get a virus and f ck up your phone thats for sure. How many people in this forum alone have spyware and unwanted bloomin pop ups.



You buy this phone for what it is not what it isnt. iphone is a great phone with he best screen ever seen and an user interface thats unrivalled.



Best phone i`ve ever owned, recent phones ive had have been n73, n95 8gb, viewty, nothing comes close trust me.
i went for the more technical v3x :D



got an n95 now, and boy do i love it. phone geeks dream
iPhone is catered to teens or lemmings whose last phone was dumbphone like RAZR. iPhone is a fashion accessory, not a real phone. If u r a real business owner, this phone is a joke for the media attention it gets. You'll get bored of it soon n realize how useless it can really be like I did in the longer run. Limited video codec support, no A2DP, no FM radio, cant customize mp3 songs or DL files when browsing, and useless eyecandy apps when jailbroken. Even as a consumer device, it lacks. Jobs is a better magician than Blaine or Angel. Fooled u all with this Paris Hilton of all cellphones!
does any one know where i can down load games for this phone

yesterday i try to connect my iphone with other pc and fck with other pc working well mmmm...... so i looking what wrong with my comp till now. but when i open with my comp below show " digital still camera" but when i connect with other pc i dont see that text mmmmmm
First moment when i did get this phone and i turned  it ON i was not too much Happy to see this that it does not have many softwares in it,not even a sound recorder :-((  but after Intallting the 3rd party softwares i am damm happy with it, its Amazing Gadget & too fast also ...... its recommended to everyone who like to feel a bit different.





Excellent Apple. Have a dedicated multi-media phone, but your camera is only 2MP no auto-focus, and cannot record video? Im sure even a K850 or N82(despite a dramatically smaller display comparatively) would be a much more useful and superior multi-media phone than the iPhone.



At least those phones can record at least QVGA resolution.
j@n{



yup! it als0 has a 3G functi0n as well as GPS!
Experience shows that a vendor with only one smart phone design, no matter how good that design is, will soon struggle.
I have an iPhone can it video call! ?or video  voice mail
muhahahahahhahahaha all u punks now the iphone has the most memory muahahahahahahahhahahahah!
hal

Thanks very much i got it!
3 months later and I still think my iphone is the works! never fell for the hype, just tried it and loved it! Been a few mths since its release and still nothing can come close to comparing.



If anyone is thinking of getting either n82, n95, prada, viewty, htc, k850 trust me choose the iphone and you wont be dissapointed
My dear Jay dnt u tnk the ipone is a bit too manly, de prada is more girly, i mean im still looking at features bt i feel lik cud kill sumone wit de size of the iphone. Plus de prada features r nt badI was poppin' bottles with my buddy a couple days ago and he got some on my iPhone. I dried it off and it still worked!!! I love this phone but the service sucks my left nut.
SE-X1 c0uld SERI0USLY be my next ph0ne!!! that thangs' l00kin H0T right n0w!!!
I bought my I- phone a week ago. And sold it today.



It has gr8 features such as ipod



amazin tft touch screen and many many more installers.



If so than why did I sell it.



Well it doesn`t work with the 3g sim card. Once installed u just cant make phonecalls. NEW SIM CARDS that r being provided by orange - France just refuse 2 work with it.



Than even with the old sim it takes ages 2 connect 2 the internet with the EDGE in europe. Than it has great problems with switching between the networks once u go abroad.



I am aware that most of the americans dont travel outside america but us europeans actually do.



I must say that it was a big disapointment
Time to weigh in as an iPhone owner now instead of just a fan-boy.



I have used many phones over the past few years - some subsidized, some not. Most have been small, flip phones (Razr, Razr V31, Sync, Nokia 6131, 6290) and not PDA type phones. I find the iPhone's largest jump between it and these type of phones to be its UI. It works and has plenty of nifty features inside it that help it be a consistent experience.



The web browser, network connection, email and IM are all very well done (the home screen notifies you when you have new messages and how many) and the size of the screen actually lets you use it as a web/email browser without tearing you hair out.



It isn't perfect though. Apple could stand to update several areas that aren't picture-perfect. The call log list, though nicely readable (red highlights missed calls) needs a deliniation between incoming and outgoing calls. Also, getting info on a contact doesn't allow editing, or a quick jump to the actual contact. On the iPod side of things, the iPhone will fade out a song to alert you to a call, then take you right back to the beat you left off at (very Apple-like-cool), but doesn't do the same for videos, instead taking you back to the video list.



I am rating it as a solid 8 and I am not done playing with it. I would love things like voice-dial, GPS recevier (location pinning only gets close, not quite close enough), and updated Bluetooth handling, but for me they aren't deal-breakers.



Final word - don't just hate something because it's made by a company you have an issue with. I was pretty close to getting a Tilt, but the pricing (non-subsidized at this point on my contract) kept me away.
I cant wait to see the next iphone it will be great.
the on screen keyboard is virtually impossible to use for those with fingers
hahahah bluetooth only for headset such a stupid idea"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Â­!!!!!
hi Iv got question about the speakers ,is sound is stereeeeoooo?????

my phone just mono
Your so proud of the 16gb upgrade only? LOL Steve please wake up!
Sorry it wasnt a patent filing but a trademark filing, but still exciting :P
iPhone 2 will not be out until much later this year. The 16gb model upgrade will hold sales until its ready.



Most likely iPhone 3g will be out at the earliest June in America and around Christmas again for Europe.



But AT&T have already slipped up and said iPhone 3G will be out in 2008 for definate.



What's more exciting is recent news that Apple have filed patents for gaming devices, both handheld and console form! Apple Pippin take 2! lol



Really hope they make a games console to take on xbox 360. I can see it now Apple iGame!! Lol
The price is justified in my opinion. For what you are getting its relatively cheap. Not long ago iPods cost ï¿½300 for just single MP3 function and nothing else.



Also take into account because you are paying for the phone outright, it is not classed as a subsidized phone. This means you can change your tariff once a month instead of having to wait every 3-6 months.



Most importantly it means when iphone 3G comes out you can purchase that no matter what stage your tariff is at, i.e there is no need to wait until the end of your 18 month contract in order to buy it like most phone contracts. I have only had my iPhone for 2 months but if iPhone 3g came out tomorrow I could buy it and register it to my current number and carry on as usual without having to increase my 18 month contract or take out a new one.
r0ck



now what do u say abt Nokia n96 which is equipped with 16 gb mem, 5mpx camera, gps, fm radio, secondary camera, wifi and what not.
Any news on thew iphone 2
Iphone is a very nice phone so those who are complaining about it back off and get another model instead of coming on here every 2 seconds trying to put the iphone down because I know deep down your wanting one but it's too expensive.



Anyway the positives of the iphone, 16gb, best sound on any mobile, best internet browser, slick i could keep going on for ages, big fan of apple keep up the good work and people seem to forget they have only been in the mobile phone industry about 2 years now and sony ericsson and nokia have been around for about 50 years and still havn't come accross anything new and exciting for ages now.



yay the iPhone rating has dropped ^_^
dude, STFU!!! if apple ddnt REV0LUTI0NIZE the m0bile ph0ne market wit der HUGE "t0uchscreen" success(u knw wut im talkin abt) SE pr0bably W0ULD N0T have c0me up wit the SEX1.



get ur facts str8, h0mes!
Apple, your first warning shot is from SE. Beware of Xperia X1. 3G all over the world and real arc-like QWERTY that doesnt smudge your touchscreen everytime. Even if a 3G iPhone is released, u r still in trouble. Go back marketing mp3 players. Only market that made u mainstream. Let the seasoned vets take it from here.
i like this phone
The ring tone level and speaker phone is the biggest let down for this phone.

Even at maximum volume, the ringing tone is sooooo low you can only just hear it.

Forget listening to your music via loudspeaker.



No blue tooth file transfer, even for pictures.


Why get a 8gb iphone when there's a 16gb one out now.



Never trust people on here when they try to sell there iphone on here, they are fakes and your guaranteed to be ripped off besides buying the iphone from a o2 store your warranty is valid
new yahoo service all in one..for mobile





http://mobile.yahoo.com/;_ylt=..._LvqCtpWtQcJ
For crying out loud i want to buy the iphone because it is Apple and the touch interface and for ï¿½270



LMAO...



but SE W910i a simple phone kick iphone arse again..
heey guys...



so, i bought the f700 and in some way i like it more than the i-phone...

i really didnt like it!!!



i read here that the bluetooth on this phone only supports a headset and there is no infrared so I am presuming you can not exchange ringtones videos and pictures with this "phone" can someone confirm what the story is ??
all of u all talking crap about the iphone either dont know much about phones or are just against apple. iphone is the best phone in the market rite now and its been 8 months ow that no one has been able to come out with the same touch interface as the iphone.
Info from the Gadget Show.



The online rumour mill is all a-rumble again, this time claiming that Apple is beavering away on its own games machine.



The iPod-maker, you see, has just filed a patent application that makes mention of several forms of handheld device, including games-centric ones. Nothing too concrete there, you're probably thinking, but the fact that Apple is reportedly also advertising a job vacancy for a "game producer/developer" has got e-tongues wagging.



Could there be a gaming iPod on the cards, ready to go toe-to-toe with the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP? Or could Apple's activity mean a slew of games are heading for existing devices (our guess would be the iPhone and iPod Touch)? We'll just have to wait and see...



We care because...

The hottest gadget maker on the planet heading into the games market? What's not to like?



We want one...

Out TBC

ï¿½TBC

Apple
thanks apple for ruining the smartphone market!  novelty now takes priority over functionality!
@cfizzl3

Yeah they can add all those gaming features u mentioned and maybe an xbox 360, ps3 and sqeeze in a wii ey. Dont b stupid! If u want a console buy 1 dont expect a slick fone 2 be an xbox come on.
okay so. i own this. I am moderately satisfied but not overly impressed.



i think apple could wipe the floor if they did 5 simple things.



1) Put a directional pad where the home button is like conventional phones.



2) Increased the camera efficiency. (5mp will become the new standard very soon).



3) Place two buttons, much like the ngage, above the screen.



4) Came out with great games.



5) 3G



This would allow them to:



Take away the cellphone/all in one market by offering the friendly platform, multimedia and gaming experience, which in turn places comeptition towards not only all other phones....but the PSP, Game Boy DS, and Nokia Ngage.
A nice copy of d prada phone!
rock why do you accuse allan of being a saleslady?



nobody finds it funny at all. No-one ever did. in fact its probably the worst joke since whats brown and sticky.



but i can see allans point. everyone here goes on about "Wow its apples first attempt". well its also garmins first attempt they do have a far better equipped device than this one.



you know that with apple you're always going to get a product which is missing out basic features.



the ipod never had a radio and could only play 1 video format (get in!)



the iphone also cant forward messages and cant MMS.



ur all better off buying nokias. they know what they're doing, and when they release a touchphone, well, need i say more? it will be awesome and actually do something.
also the iphone 16GB is now avalable . . .
Experience shows that a vendor with only one smart phone design, no matter how good that design is, will soon struggle.
Look Dude, my girl has the iphone, it really sucks.  she can barely text with it. It has good look but not easy to operate.  i would never spend $600 to by this piece of s--t.
Holloway



0H F0R CRYIN' 0UT L0UD!!!!! if apple wants t0 c0py s0mething, LET THEM!



the wh0le M0BILE W0RLD's already c0pied s0mthing fr0m the iPh0ne!!!



d0 u have a 'clue' what it is?????
Why iPhone is not the best phone in 2007? cos SE kicks iPhone arse from Barcelona back to the states
all I see are noobs happy with the 2nd best. The 1st best is the imate jasjar. BUt it's not as marketed ar the iphone
i buy iphone 2 days ago.... anyone can tell me how to transfer sim phonebook...please........help me
it's so bad you can not buy it in belgium....I have what i consider to be a iphone , however it looks slighty different from the one shown here.
Without doubt the finest mobile I've ever owned. I purchased one last week from eBay (unlocked) and have been using it non-stop since with my current Vodafone sim. This is a piece of electronics that only comes along maybe once every 5-6 years that simply blows you away. The last time I had this kind of experience was the first time I witnessed a GPS device doing exactly what we had been promised for many years.. 'WORK'. It breaks down so many technological barriers. GPS (works), Touchscreen technology (works), mobile internet/email (works) and finally the all-important 'ease of use' (works). GET ONE..!
hey im goin 2 buy an unlocked iphone but since i leave in czech republic the itune store doesnt sell songs here.i have itunes program but i download songs from other places and just store them there.if i synchronise my iphone with the itunes will it cause it 2 relock again?hope sm1 can help me
Looks like a cool phone.Wot should i pick?This 1 or the HTC tytn II?
i'm dying to have one...

argh!!!

dead!
Look's fantastic, thank's for sharing about the nvidia apx 2500. I googled it!
This is the phone to buy. I have bought one yesterday and let me tell you people that if you have ï¿½300 to spend on a mobile phone do not think twice and buy one of these devices. Forget Nokia arte and N95 and N96. No mobile can touch this device. Assalamun aleykum.
hey guys have you heard about Nvidia APX 2500? still a prototype, but once realized you may even forgot that once there was an iphone.
I have just bought an unlocked iphone...but i am not able to do conferencing between two calls on this phone. Anyone has an idea how to do so.....when i try to merge calls, it does not allow...



thanks in advance for your replies



abhay
I have the Apple iPhone and it isn't good.



Yes agreed the touch screen and picture editing stuff is great, and yes the internet is quite good, but has tons of flaws.



No Bluetooth as we know it, it does only support a headset and that's it.

No Multimedia messaging, which I thought was so crappy.



The worst thing is you can't have your own ringtones, Itunes has made this impossiblt now, you have to buy a ringtone from itunes which is very limited and then buy the software to edit it into a ringtone etc, absolutely rubbish.



Internet is crap too, i use a java chat room quite frequently and can't even access that, it just keeps saying Safari cannot open this web page etc etc etc.



Believe me people, this phonw is not worth the money and you may think 269.99 is cheap on o2, but considering the 18 month contract and the fact that there are only a choice of 3 tariffs it's rubbish.  my tariff is the ï¿½35 a month one i get 200 mins and 100 texts with unlimited data, which is crap to say i was originally on o2 paying ï¿½30 a month for 400 mins and 1500 texts, it's a rip off phone with contract and if I had known I wouldn't have bought one in the first place.



please make damn sure you want it sooo bad before you buy.  oh and 3 days after buying it they bring out a 16gb version and i'm not able gto swap it.

be warned!!!!!
I sent my 8GB iphone back within the 14 day period so I could get the 16GB iphone.

Just have to pay an extra ï¿½60.00
No 3G !! hhh smart very smart!!



No Games !!



No gps only google maps



camera 2mp only without Flash !!



No video camera



No HSCSD



No copy & paste Files



No infrared and bluetouch support headset only !! how can you exchgane ringtones!!



No FM



battery life only 250



No MMS only sms and email!!



weight 135g



No Arabic language support -all others like nokia s-ericsson Mt support arabic



Rock

Please POINT OUT where i said NOKIA revolutionized Touchscreen? Please point it out! quote it

I didn't say such a thing, i used NOKIA AS AN EXAMPLE, they were up to a touchscreen S60 UI before i-Phone was announced, it had been mentioned on MANY FORUMS but it was being slowly developed and once i-Phone hit THEN it was given a thumbs up and faster development, theres no fanboism in that just FACT which you just can't take.
seif. I bought viewty mths ago thinking would be an iPhone killer. 5 mp cam , video etc. But sent back after 3 days and bought iPhone. For me personally the best phone and gadget I've ever owned! Can't rate it high enough.
"i read here that the bluetooth on this phone only supports a headset and there is no infrared so I am presuming you can not exchange ringtones videos and pictures with this "phone" can someone confirm what the story is ??

* Steph"





Yeap, i can`t exachange files with other phones...crappy i know!:D
no one can come up with the methods of multi touch used with the iphone bcoz apple have 'pateneted' them so thats the reason no one is comming with the same zoom in/heatsenstive touch screen for now.
I luv the Iphone design and Hype.



But Frankly, they lack of a real communication tools as explain by GSM Review. Check what this phone LACKING before u decided to buy.



Anyhow, this is Apple first step to mobile communication. Looking forward for Iphone 2nd model..
multi-touch isnt it?



any other phones offer that yet?
Hey dude nick can you tell me wut its called not just touchphone

thanx dude
id wait for the nokia touchphone coming out later this year :)yeah its a decent program, only problem i`ve found is that I prefer to stay on 1.1.2 at the moment and dont really want to upgrade to 1.1.3 just yet, 1.1.2 more 3rd party apps and more stable from what i hear.
hey guys



have u heard about ZiPhone, find it at www.ziphone.com. i upgraded my 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 and unlocked, activated and jailbroken in 15 mins time. beleive it or not!!!!!!
this is an abssolutely amazing phone and it is so easy to use and the internet is fast and full
Exactly I agree!  Let us know how you get on mate.
Thanks,just going to give it a go and see if that helps......



This is what these forums are for rather than slating everyone elses phones
All you need to do is poke a needle or pin through the speaker holes ( as your looking down at the phone with screen facing you the speaker is down at the bottom on the left hand side) and just pierce the rubber membrain, dont worry the speaker is no where near so u wont do any damage. Your increase the volume by 40%. Makes a massive difference trust me.
Thats exactly what happens when phones like the n95 are mass produced using cheaply made parts and circuitry etc, they go faulty! when nokia take the time and effort to make a well made phone using decent parts you dont see many returns ie : the 8800 series, same goes for the iphone, its very well made using top materials hence why you see hardly any returns.
Sorry new on this thread......and i dont really fancy reading 240+ pages, can you enlighten me to the needle/pin trick,



Thanks
Yes your right the original volume levels arnt the best on the iphone but if you do the needle/pin trick you can increase the volume by 40%... Did mine and works a treat!!
new accessory for the iphone. A hearing aid so you can actually hear when a call is coming in, especially in loud places or when the person next to you has their n95 mp3 player on.
Working in a repair center for mobile phones i see many phone comes in for repair every day and since we started selling the iphone i've seen one faulty (other than physical customer damage). From the other side i've seen hundreds and hundreds of Nseries phones, mainly N95's (although as of yet only a dozen or so N95 8GB).....



In summary the iphone has in general less faults...considering its not from a big mobile phone manufacturer.



But that said best manufacturer by a long long way is Sony, they will take alot to beat and if Nokia dont pull their game and come up with a good phone soon they will be overtaken by Samsung aswell.....god forbid!
'stead 0f c0mplainin 'b0ut thingz u can actually juss buy a bluet00th a2dp 'adapter' if ya really need it!
godda forget about linking your bluetooth headphone, iPhone sux big time
i just wanna know if the iphone supports A2DP link?? i wana use my JBL bluetooth sterio headphones with it?? plzz let me know
heey allan,



i've got a f700... i really love it..

what is going on here...

haha.... youre all little baby's haha...
a beautiful phone, on the outside. if  want bling, perfect phone for you. graphics and interface are superb. functionality is another topic. if u want functionality, go to nokia or sony ericsson. leaves-much-to-be-desired camera and music player. to those who want to disagree, simply hit the compare link and chose any N/E series nokia phone and slowly close your mouth as you realize the error of your ways...hahaha
why dont every one talk or discuss iphone rather than bitch about nokia,s all the time .

gsm ban prats off this site as they are letting a real good informative site down badly ...

Can't even send my lil bro a picture of his favoite team via Bluetooth transfers. How lame. Just like he can't delete a song on the fly.
Hey Rossotron, Hows tricks still loving your brick phone?
Lovely phone.......and it has only crashed once when i tried taking a photo of Jimmy G, a guy i work withI can receive e-mails without being in an edge area, i havent actually been able to get an edge coverage in my area (plymouth) since getting the phone.



This does however cause problems with youtube as this DOES need an edge connection.
if this is intended to be used for some business purposes then its just crap. i mean the web browser doesnt support flash (LOL?)



the emails come in via edge? (in the UK thats like 30% coverage as most of it is 3G).



i do complain but i just want one for some reason



I can see the code, but that happens to be cause we are on the same computer network for the same company you dum sh*t
Lee



You are a Blackberry lover, in less than 1500 words tell me the differences, advantages and disadvantages of a blackberry as opposed to an iphone.....



Go!
No as far as i can see its exactly the same except the extra memory
Does the 16gb iphone have any new features from the 8gb one (other than the memory size)



Cheers
hi mr ahmad



it's very easy to install software. u must be connected to internet via ur phone network or wi-fi. if it is so, proceed as under



1. tap installer.

2. tap install, or if u r doing for first  , tap source and then refresh at the left top corner.

3. after refreshing, tap install at the left bottom.

4. find a lot of software, choose one and tap install at the right top corner.



care: dont upgrade ur phone from here, it will lock again. cheers
Networks have always had the ability to unlock phones and in the UK especially when a contract runs out the network (excepting 3) will normally allow a customer to unlock a phone, even help them to do it as after a contract a customer isnt tied to that network anymore.



How this will figure with the iphone is a different story as it appears when you upgrade the phone on itunes it re-locks the handset. So our customer rights seem to be violated.



Anyway back to the gist of this post, the network has the ability to unlock the phones and if AT&T have an abundance of iphones, too many to sell, then it wouldnt suprise me if they try to get something back for them by unlocking and selling.
From some source had told me that AT&T has a back door for selling unlock iPhone that is already been simm lock free. Due to over stock, AT&T can not sell out all of their Iphone. AT&T is responsible of masses iPhone that is been sold in black market today.



No individual person can buy masses sealed Iphone with newly firmware updated and unlock.



AT&T has the right of what they want to do with the iPhone. Unlock or not unlock.

can anyone tell me how to add applications on my iphone. its already unlocked and everythin
hey my friend got this phone... its far good.The interface is fast.But one thing,am sure this phone wont suit for rough handling.

hi jeffB



u dont need to buy any software for ur iphone. get connected to internet via ur service provider or wi-fi of ur pc/mac. find installer button from the desktop of ur fone, press it, refresh and find a host of software displayed. chose and install.



cheers
hi anas,



i tried to find out such softwares but could not. whatever available in the site, some how rather u got buy.



i forgot to answer one of ur ques. FW 1.1.1 of iphone is good and stable, u may continue with that. i upgraded my one to 1.1.3 and found no difference excepct replacing of icons on the display just by pushing. 1.1.1 has more software in the internet.



if u want to at all upgrade, then do it from the itunes. total file size is 162 mb. a slow computer/connection would take hours.



my one i did with download speed 30 kpbs and took 62 mins. if u r successful in upgrading, the do the unlock, activation and jailbreak in about 2.5 mins. i will assist u in doing so.



Can anyone tell me to where to find IPHONE and IPOD Touch applications on line to buy?

Thanks

Some claim it shall be out with the sdk, some say it shall facility like bluetooth transfer, some say message forwarding option is coming. However its not very clear.

harhar! its nice to be back! grrrrr! -bradd
I sent my 8GB iphone back a few days ago just waiting for my 16GB iphone to arrive.

I have missed it
I just got this phone yesterday. And all I can say is that it has been the best phone I ever had :) ... if you're all about features, this phone is not for you. But if you like user-interface, pda, elegant and music, you will like this phone.



I previously own an SE K790a and a few others Nokia, and they all suck. So I was quite annoyed of some other people promoting N95 (features good, but suckie graphic user interface).
this phone has a really good design, no doubts, but there are many phones with better features than this one. I have N82, and it has 5 MP camera, this one only 2 and no bluetooth. It is embarrassing,even my freezer has a bluetooth.
is the best..maybe have some bad things but wee can live whith that..and their will be fixed whit some guys hoo nows that iphone is realy the next step..is wonderful as an ipod makes good pics..safari rules'and a lot of things thanks too ziphone'i change my phone at 3months but this one will stay untild 3g european iphone  comes out and wee all will be hapy-)))
Woooaaaw!!!
the iphone happily records videos at a resolution of 0x0 at 0 frames a second.
can this phone send photos via bluetooth? can this phone make videos? (what is the rezolution of videos?and the frame rate?)
iphone is okay..... i guess
Would be great to have a phone like this with the technology of nokia n95
ayt nick.... if ya say s0. we'll leave it be abt d f/w. i did hear sum nice things abt it s0 'r0ck 0n' nahmsayin??? l0l.



& ur right, there is N0 law against buyin 'high-cap' batts iz juz dat peepz hu buy 'extra' batts r GENERALLY unhappy wit their 'current' batt's perf0rmance.



maybe urz iz different??? i dunn0.
im not saying its too short. it used to be short but the new f/w seems to have done wonders.



why cant i buy a longer battery? there no law against it.hal



like broadband, baseband is a kind of transmission of wireless frequency used by the modem of iphone. it's the level of security. 4.6 is more encrypted than 3.9
ok thx stranger

ill try it out tonite!

will let u know how it goes ;)
hi hal



yes ur bootloader/baseband is v4.6 since it is 112 otb. i suggest u better install ziphone, and read "help and info" from ziphone gui3.



also read the relevant links available there.





i phone is the best phone
hi stranger,



thx alot for the valuable info!!!

ill try it out tonite, and hopefully will have no problems ^^

but got a question about this step



"unmark erase baseband. also see the version of baseband, it should be v3.9 or below. now click "do it all"."



wt u mean by see the version of baseband? shouldnt my otb 112 have baseband 4.6?



thx!
i would love one, but im not allowed one :(



best phone ever
here are negative things against iphone and need improvement if am the owner of the company apple

#first thing which has make me not sleep for two days..i drop the device first day and break the glass(improvement need even hand holder,,,like string).too smooth to hold.

#second thing the batery life need some improvment.

#why...why...whyy..whhy..bluetooth only work for headset only.....its set back.Apple is it for security?

#People r now in 3g high speed with video...i dont see anything

#IF the whole phone is in touching screen why the home button is mannual why?

#POSITIVE THING NO OTHER MOBILE PRODUCER BEAT APPLE THIS IS OPEN AND NO BODY CAN AVOID NEITHER THE NOKIA OR ELSE....THXXX

i had this phone 3 month a go its not really good if you want sth like this try htc touch
hi all



iphone is really a wonderful invention. initiall we all got frustrated looking at it's limited features. with the dev of sftwares, an iphone can do anything one can imagine.



we, atleast me, once was dead against of this device. frustration burdened me a lot, but gradually it releived.



if u can exploit its full capabilities, be the happiest.



however, i still love htc touch with wm6 and sent for hibernation for few days. thousands of softwares are aval.



iphone, generally will not betray u. under any adverse condition, u can get it back alive except hardware problem (where chances are remote). pls do not make it over-worked.



OUT LAWZ



i am not an expert in iphone. i just gathered some knowledge by handling,  reading various articles, upgrading, installing softwares and at times bricking my fone also.
hi anas



i dont know ur likings. there are plenty of softwares. if u r in 113 fw and not loaded any additional softwares, u r left with only 54 mb of free space in the "c" drive of the fone. again if u have loaded BSD subsystem, u will only have 40 MB. this is small. however u can relocate ur fonts from c drive to d/e drive using "bosstool". u may be advised later.



i listed before a host of software one should have. u can install many of them, if not liking delete it.



remember if u install BSD subsystem which takes abt 15 MB of storage, u cannot uninstall it. however, without BSD u can also install a good numbers of softwares.

infact, i have installed mostly dictionaries and ebooks, themes, games (chess, solitire etc)

the system softwares occupy the base memory (of 300 mb). application softwares take place in d/e drive.



enjoy
thanks again "stranger"



what is the best softwares to downlaod for my iphone ?!?
@ bai,

thank u very much!!... but um... where would i get a iPhone ringtone thingy?
O2 have announced that the iPhone will be released in Ireland on the 14th March. FINALLY!!!!
Where do i get iphone ringtone maker?
@ chess



after jb, unlock, activate process,

u can then upload ringtone onto your iphone using iphone ringtone maker.
wow stranger!

that would be much appreciated if you could email me

u have an account on gsmarena?

i can pm u for my mail adres and stuff?



just to clarify my iphone version.

firmware version 04.02.13

otb 1.1.2 firmware

alrdy jailbroken+turbo sim unlocked

i dont have an AT&T sim card



thx stranger!
there is no visual change between 113 and 114. in 114 some changes in the internal fw have been made with which the common users have nothing to do. but there are visualchanges in 113, u can customise the icons and place those anywhere in the board.
If i have a unlocked iPhone can i use my own MP3 as ringtones? or do i have to purchase them from iTunes?.... Plz let me know..... thx
mjQx



yes, the 'feeling' 0f havin' a MAC in ur 'p0cket' when u have an iPh0ne is just exquisite.



^_^hi dan,



noproblem. go to recovery mode. connect ur fone with pc and itune. click restore. all data will be erased.



u will see itune logo and a cable. itune will take care. once  restore is done, if u r not using at&t sim, it will lock. no matter. run ziphone to unlock, activate and jailbreak.



cheers
You have to jailbreak the iPhone's file system in order to put software (games included) on it.
My Iphone crashed today :(( the display suddently turned black, he look like still open, but it's dead... I'll wait until he runs out of battery and I'll try to open it back... hope it works. Somebody knows something about this?? PLEASE HELP... it 8GB iphone...
anthony,



this fone possesses a good numbers of ad-on features now. initially, i was also frustrated like u. it's not over-rated,but it's a classic piece. u must agree, no other fone is like iphone. it is unique. these days there so many numbers of softwares are available that u get tempted, which one to be rejected.

there could have been some more sofistication in areas, like camera, 3g, video etc.

hey guys i think this phone is so over rated seriously its going back in time 2 megapixel camera like why not 5 the n95 is a much better phone in the end
thanx jc
hal,



look for bug fix, or add-on icon for wedict from installer. u r running which fw?
hi hal,



there could be some fw problem in ur fone. i am in 114. no problrm at all. wedict working fine. have u installed bsd subsystem? most of the prog need it.
hi stranger,



i checked in customize. like the program "wedict" i have a little eye in front of it, just like other programs that i can see on main screen.

but still wedict doesnt show on main screen.

any thoughts?

however ive found out. eg: "weather" in customize has a little eye in front, then the little sun which is the icon for "weather"

but for wedict, i only see the eye and "wedict" no icon for itself.

know wt i mean?



thx
"Supreme web surfing experience"!? No 3G!? And still they want to claim "Supreme web surfing experience"!? Hahahaha!!!



Unfortunately, that is the pivotal point for me not to get one... In everything else, the idea seems great, but no 3G makes it seem 5 years old, which is very unfortunate.



Sorry Apple, upgrade to 3G and HSDPA and you will gain a significant amount of support, in my opinion.
KC,

yes u can use iphone even without sim.

u can use wifi, camera and other features EXCEPT the phone feature of course...



jc
expect 3G when 4G phones are out in the market...
yeah about 6 minutes
does anyone here have an idea that by when can we expect the provision of 3G in iPhone???
Hy abhay



you need just to download summerboard application, there youll see the option to hido or show the wallpaper



guys, please confirm that iphone can be used without inserting sim card.thanx
This is a revolution in mobile best phone
hi abhay



ur fone is with fw 113 or 114. i am with 114. a fix for this problem is available but does not run. at this moment u cannot save the walpapers in camera roll/wallpaper. wait for another bug fix.



i dont know abt blackberry
hi has the phone got a alarm clock
Have two queries on iphone. i have a 8 GB unlocked iphone...on this when i set a wall paper it sets it only on first page where you get a message like " slide to unlock" once i am into the screen carrying applications...i dont get my wallpaper there...how do i rectify this



Also want to know if the new 16GB iphone supports blackberry connection



thanks

abhayBuy the china iphone clone it is cheaper and very good than this one. I bought one for $200 only i dont regret anything it has pretty decent features.
You can have bold and italicized, Larger and Smaller, or it could look type-written
I think apple iphone is a brilliant phone. but its not that easy to use because it has nothing you have to install everything. The one thing that bugs me is that you cant set your ringtone from ur songs its just the one from the phone. so does anyone know how to do that. I gave my phone to upgrdae it to 1.1.3 to 1.1.4 so please can you help me out, thanks.

to Hal & Stranger:



I'm not sure how it works but my phone had baseband 4.6 and my iphone was OTB 1.1.2. Irestored it to 1.1.4 and I used iJailbreak which is a mac version based on Ziphone technology. everything works fine including works fine and youtube.
good gsm internet works great!
when i touched prada of LG, it gave me a feelings of a child toy. it's totally made of plastic, very light in weight, and could not impress me at all. in my country, iphone is occupying the 1st position and the HTC touch is 2nd. after the introduction of iphone and HTC touch, no other palm top are being sold in the market. note, ours market is 1 of the 10 largest cell phone market in the world. there are 30 millions mobile fone user.
Have a look at www.apple.com you will understand,

watch the quick time video

the other smart phones are officially DEAD !



With the SDK  release today and the enterprise  WAY advanced package for the Iphone all other smartphones are just sad prehistoric obsolete useless plastic paper weights.

I know many of you will understand what this mean in a few months,

but it's ok we are patient.
I had the iPhone and the Prada phone bolth since they have come out. After using each for about 3 months i find that i actually like the LG Prada 80% better. It looks better, works better, and is just better when it comes to being ractical. Of course the iPhone has a way better MP3 player but i never used it once.



I prefer the LG Prada hands down when comparing it to the iPhone
t0 tha dude wh0 said that the n95 battery SUCKS c0mpared t0 the iPh0ne - i t0tally agree!!!



ive had the n95 8GB & the iPh0ne AT THE SAME TIME & the n95 battery was H0RRIBLE.
well if y'all must c0mpare the iPh0ne 2 a wind0ws 0S the simplest thing w0uld be t0 c0mpare it t0 wind0ws xp with the additi0n 0f a service pack 2, 3, and s0 0n.....



the wind0ws xp(iPh0nes mac 0s x m0bile) w0uld be the main 0S and the service packs 2/3/etc. w0uld be the iPh0nes FIRMWARE upgrades(102/111/112/113/114).
good but not gud enough
hal



before u wish to upgrade to any higher version, pls check ur baseband version. it should be 3.9 and not 4.6. ziphone is not yet ready to break baseband 4.6. even if u do it, u will lose wi-fi from ur phone. iam mostly sure that ur bb version is 3.9.
mr tiko



3 days time is very small to explore the vast potentialities and capabilities of an iphone. get it back and pls ask me what all u want ur iphone to do for u. i will tell u.



i slo had the same opinion like u initially. now i have a complete changed mind.



try again pls
hi easyD



u r slightly mistaken. it's not like win98, xp, etc. the iphone runs on mac ox 10.4.... whic is a operating system and 111/112/113/114 are the fw version for this phone. like ms word 2000/2006 working in win98/win xp operating system. here also various fw versions are woking with mac ox 10.4.......





hi hal,



yes ziphone 2.5 is available for 114. u can safely use. i am in 114 now and did it all by ziphone 2.5

stranger,



thx!!! i understand now. so the reason it doesnt work. is coz many developers upgraded versions for 113 or higher.

so basically 111 is no longer the best version, as lots of apps are not applicable i found out.

is ziphone alrdy available to upgrade to 114?



thx
everybody thinks the iphone is so cool...but there is so many limits on it..unless you break into it...but appels keeps coming with updates to stop third party softwares...if you ask me...all these 3rd party softwares could help apple...screw the iphone its stupid
Hey Miky, The versions are more like the operating system upgrades. Kinda like Windows 95, 98, Xp etc.. If you just bought your phone, chances are it will come with the latest system version (1.1.4) which is jailbreakable and unlockable in a matter of +-5 minutes.
Any news about the iPhone 2 ???
dear possesors of iphones, i have ordered one from USA n it will arrive in the next 2 weeks..But I don't undeerstand what u all r talkin bout these versions..is it sometin u have to upragrade sometimes?the same is says to the ipod when u sync it to itunes whwnever is a new version available?

Please be so kind and make me clear my mind, coz i hope i didn't make a bad choice buyin an iphone...hope i'm not to insistant..Thankx RIM ..................Plzz Anyone can tell In Iphone how to Video recordin??................ Any Software in Iphone need for video Recording...
I would strongly doubt they will update the bluetooth to send files, as i said, it breaks all copy laws
is the bluetooth gonna be upgraded to share files in the form of music and pictures?.



and whre can i get the chepeast iphone?
Surely the lack of bluetooth for bluetoothing files is to help with copy protection that people seem to disregard so freely these days.......I cant remember the last time i received a file from someone on a phone, it was all about people wanting my music or pics etc so its not really a great loss for me.



If its something you do then this phone, currently, isnt for you....
Can I use the Apple iPhone in the Philippines? What is the battery performance of the phone under extreme condition (use of voice call, video and audio). Thanks
i-phone is compared to  person who is beautiful but "BRAINLESS"!!!!!U really pay for brand name! as the old saying says:"what is beauty if the braIn is empty"!



i rther choos i-mate ultimate 6150, looks not so nice but intelligent.... now thats beauty (not so) WITH BRAIN (AT LEAST)...
Does this thing have bluetooth stereo support? From what I could tell it does now, but how can that be true!?!?



I'll stick with my SE W890 with 8 Gb memory, steroe bluetooth and 3G. :-)
fw 1.1.1 , 1.1.2, 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 / there is not much of differences amongst these fw. various bugs have been fixed one after another. pls note, as the fw are updated, the application softwares are also updated accordingly. for example, mim, banner, wedict etc now will probably not work with other than 1.1.4. very few softwares will be left for older version of fw.
Hi, can someone please tell me the difference between the 1.1.2 and 1.1.3, and will it make a diference on which one i buy
plz guys

can any one help me wether to buy the iphone or not?

I got nokia e61i

thnx
I think its a very very sexy phone.. The price is bit on a higher side in India.

What is the availability of the service centers in India.

The iPhone does have alarm function. It is in the clock menu. Please check properly before passing your comments. The iPhone is not as great as N95 just because it doesn't have MMS (yet), video recording (yet) and 3G service. All this will come in time via apple's state of the art firmware upgrades. Watch out for the upcoming 2.0 new firmware due in late June.



So please do not trash the iPhone as it has a lot of untapped potential which is still in the making.



Note: No other phone (N95/N82/K850/W960/LG/Samsung/etc) has a stable OS and eye popping effects as the iPhone.



Now beat that folks!
This one is really..good phone.But I waiting...When it will come in India.......
hi all



any kind of assistance@@@ i am here. what u need: upgrade, activate, jailbreak. ????? installaion of software and what not!!!!!
hey kendel



u r really a new user! no matter. go like this:



open installer. press sources at bottom right corner. press edit at top right corner. press edit left top corner. write the name of web ste, for example http:\\modmyifone.com and then press ok. the page will refresh and may take several mins. once done, all the new softwares under this web will be added. press install and find a number of softwares. chose any with uy fingure touch and press install.



remember , most of the software are in fw 1.1.4. if ur fone is not updated to 1.1.4 u will not be able to do so.



by the by, do u have wi-fi connection? have u installed itunes and sync ur fone.



u can browse in google to see the complete list of softwares sources. just write " iphone installer sources" and search. u will find a bunch of sources. the fav one is ride4 of shai repositor where u can add more than 94 software sources.

remember, more u add more time it will take to refresh. thats all for today.

hi new iphone users,



enough and enough have been discussed about this fone including its inherent limitations. problems of sms forward, vdo recording, mms,  etc all have been eliminated. day by day and gradually, more features are coming up. so now?????

some ppl are buying it and without exploring the vast capabilities of this fone, making all foolish comments as if, he had been using a fone better (?) than this. it is advisable for those ignorants that they refrain themselves from making such childish comments.



sorry, never mind , new ifone users.
i dunn0 y peepz r c0mplainin' s0 much abt da 3G.



havent y'all herd 0f da "free" WIFI??? l0l.



if y'all desperately NEED 3g - g0 l00k elsewhere. this AINT yer ph0ne.
hi rssndvldg



do not get frustrated by the limitations of this fone. u can have everything what u expect from this fone, except 3g. explore the websites and install all required softwares that u r looking for.
bought my iphone and is pretty disappointed with features that it has (actually doesn't have). Simple alarm is not present, bluetooth only supports headset, photo messaging sucks, sms can't be forwarded. due to absence of 3g technology ringtones can only be bought from itunes store. Anyways they plan to make it a business phone but it lacks too much stuff. Overrated phone sorry to say that, but it's true.
thanks stranger but i can t add any website if i don't know any. I need to know atleast one. For example www.gallery.mobile9.com has every thing for symbian. But for mac osx software i need a site.I think your find the majority of people who actually own an iphone really arnt bothered about the lack of 3g, waiting a few seconds more to retrieve an email or load a webpage is defo no hardship.... using the internet on any other phone even on 3g really aint that good.
You`ve obviously never owned an iphone or even used one then I take it! as for saying take away the touch screen and the phones nothing is stupid, a bit like saying a football match is rubbish without a ball.
yeah, take off the touch screen iPhone is nothing. no wonder the scores are so low
hal,



2nd figure is supposed to be a letter. however, pls read more to find out ur bb version and  proceed as per instruction of ziphone.



abid,



download iringer win xp version and install in ur pc. install itune. go to iringer and select any mp3. it will convert to iphone ringtone and save in itune ringtone. connect ur fone. select ringtone, u will see the converted ringtone there. then sync. i did in that way. it is working fine.



cheers
does this phone have GPS??

please answer on mail ..

tnx
i wish to buy iphone

but i would like know about its performance like internet browsing

video capturing

camera clarity

music

and about other applications softwares

that can be downloaded to improve its performance

and where to get such softwares

Hi:

Can anybody help me please how to use mp3 as a ringtone in iphone
i think iphone is just a start to touch screen mobile phone generation.But as a useful mobile phone , i don't think so.

I bought w960 and it is wonderful.
hi stranger



first few digits of my serial number are

86751



hope it helps
The Iphone is a lovely device
jack



thanks a lot for ur useful information.now i can put any ringtone into my fone.
Psssstt.. please don't post any comment here if you don't have any iphone in your hand. If you just know this product from internet, magazines or any brochures out there, trust me that's NOT ENOUGH. There's no enough information until you try this phone yourself. There're hundred apps you can add to make this product perfect. Who said there's no MMS? You're fool then..

I was doubt in the beginning too, but once I got it I'm amazed. None can beat this product, trust me.
can this phone video record and if it can how long can it record for?
If you want to take big pictures with nice definition, go buy a digital camera...

If you wish to use GPS, buy one... it's forbidden to use phone while driving...

Want lots of features burning your battery, charge it day by day, go buy a Nokia...

If you want all of the features you know about, please, go buy a personal computer...

Everyday someone brings a new feature to use on your phone... In a few years probably your bypass will be controled over phone...



Learn to distinguish the utility of a phone... don't speak about the features that YOU would like to see on the phone...Search them!



Just remember.. Apple is quality...

other are business!
to the bloke 2 posts below.



yeah apple patented the multi touch thing, but nokia's first touch screen is going to have multi touch, but its engineered in a different way as not to infringe copying. i think it also can take commands from you, and you dont even have to be touching the screen?  I dont know but i know its sensor crazy.



and also i think "the full internet in your pocket" is a huge overstatement because...



it doesnt support flash or java so its fairly restricted. oh and its not 3g so unless u live in your wifi enabled house then you're going to get a bit frustrated
The iPhone is made by Apple! Enough said. As a huge fan of Apple I never have to look at other phones again. I bought this iPhone and when the new one comes out later this year I am going to buy that as well and every single one after that.



So no matter what you say about it or how many people slate it its going to be a success, every single one it releases no matter what. Even if critics slate it, it will still be a huge success because of the loyal Apple fan base who will buy it.



Also the iPhone has revolutionised internet browsing on the mobile platform. Its not only about having the full internet in your pocket but also the experience of how you browse the internet, and with multi touch its amazing.



Apple invented the multi touch so no device on the planet will ever have touch controls so precise because Apple will never give them the license to use it. Look at Samsung, LG and Nokia every touch device cannot compare to the iPhone because their controls are crap, just read every tech magazine out there, they say the same thing.
put away the touchscreen and this phone is nothig, even so i still consider the N91 far more superior.....anyway, it's a nice toy to have :)
0h yes, & did i menti0n very SLEEK-l00king as well as THIN???



u aint g0n get sumn' like that in a n-series device. n95 0wnerz u kn0w wut im talkin' b0ut! L0L!
this ph0ne is actually a REALLY G00D ph0ne.



M0ST 0f its "limitati0ns" like inability t0 "send" mms, rec0rd vide0 have been addressed & are n0w "0verc0me" by 3rd-party s0ftware via INSTALLER.



having a 3.5 screen, T0UCHSCREEN, multi-t0uch input, FULL QWERTY, FULL Y0UTUBE, easy & FUN t0 use interface, & t0 t0p it 0ff - havin' a 4/8/16GB iP0d t0 b00t is m0re than wut ur g0nna get with M0ST cells 0ut 0n the market t0day!



just d0nt ask f0r a BUILT-IN gps 0r 3G cuz ur barkin' up da wr0ng tree 0n that 0ne.
get iringer. easiest way to put on custom ringtones.sounds like a piece of poo. not even 3g, revolutionary? and no 3g? kind of an oxy moron. 2mp camera, the 6280 has a 2 mp camera so no feat there... no zoom on camera, thats another awesome as feature. whats good about this? its an ipod and a phone, not even a very good phone, i can get a better one for about 200aus dollars. and then whats good about the ipod side of it, nothing? its touchscreen, thats it
jenny



0ne w0rd - JAILBREAK.





ix5r



agreed. i have "seen" games made by EA games & SEGA f0r the iPh0ne & w/ the iPh0nes HARDWARE + ACCELER0METER - it BL0WS away ANYTHING u put in fr0nt 0f it in terms 0f cellph0ne gaming!!!
i bought iphone 3 days ago.i really confuse with this phone.cant transfer phonebook from simcard to phone.

camera cant zoom.my opinion,iphone is good for playing music,video,etc but not for handphone
which program i should use to put any song at my iphone as ringtone ( iringer doesn't work with me ) i'm on 1.1.3



and which program to forward msgs ?
this is a really great phone. yup it's not a perfect phone with full of features, but on all the features it provided all are successfully delivered, brilliantly
i'm confused when you buy a GSM phone doesn't that mean buying a phone without a plan?

doesn't apple force you to start a 2 year plan as soon as you buy it?

so is the GSM version a cheaper iphone yet you still have to activate it?
it's not really a comment im postin, but kinda more of a few things i need to know before i decide on buying it. Well first of all, i wanna know if the iphone's bluetooth works as in like the other kinds of phones, second can you put mp3 as ringtones? third, i heard that an unlocked iphone's speaker doesn't work or somethin like that, is that true?? if the phone like accidentally falls on the ground, does the display break? cuz i heard it's made of glass ?? can anyone please post me the answers? thanks ppl i really would appreciate it
its starting to get really annoying how thick people are on this forum. The SDK and third party apps will give you IM will give you MMS and text forwarding just wait till June.



The SDK will solve every single niggle people have about the iPhone and I mean everything there's not one thing you can say it wont solve software wise.



The only thing it cant do is make it 3G.
Starting to hate this phone. No camera flash, you can't forward txt message, you cant send mms no zoom on camera. You can't copy and paste. This is more of an ipod than phone. I want to switch with my blackberry.. This has no IM also. No games.
I dont know why people are whinging about battery life on the iPhone mine last for 3 days before I charge it up. Thats with Wi-Fi constantly on and with average of 1.5 hours of calls per day and some texting and web browsing, along with weather checking and google maps.



Also remember iPhone is about to go supernova on video games in June when the first apps from the SDK are officially released. The iPhone hardware is more powerful than both the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS. So iPhone will produce better graphics than anything you can get on a Sony PSP. In addition you get axis movement sensors like PS3 gamepad due to the accelerometer.



With the SDK you'll be able to download 3rd party apps which will give you video capture and MMS messaging and GPS. So the only thing haters can say now is it has no 3G which amounts to 4 seconds of quicker loading if u manage to get 3G coverage in the first place.



To those saying without the touchscreen its nothing, If the touchscreen isn't a big deal why is every company coping it? If the iPhone isnt revolutionary why is Windows Mobile 7 an exact copy/rip off of the interface and gestures used on iPhone.
only 2 mpx camera.....
Great

As with all Apple items ....... it works great. As with all apple items don't ask it to do any thing extra. Blue tooth 2.0 ??? Only works for phone calls!!! No GPS!!! Great display. Won't do flash?????.... All in all great if you want a toy!!!! Not really a PDA..... more of a phone, with mp3 player. I wouldn't buy another one, stick with a PPC device.
This is a really nice phone... i lov it....
Its a sexi phone in this world when i saw this ph I for in love with it.Im just traing to bay this ph.
Apple i phone is better than 1100..

thats all i can say..

its k
apple is a sexy phone...

i love to have it ..

i go crazy when i see itt..

bt the camera pixel sucks..

I'm just understanding the iphone nicely but the problem i've been facing is how can i save any file attched (Picture) with an emial, to my iphone?

in some areas of my city (Faisalabad, Pakistan), i cannot even connect through the EDGE.

can any body tell me how to do these all things?

regards.....
i read all the opinion and i agree for all people, i bought this phone last 10 day's ago and i am very happy when i got in my hand but i got some problem with it first of all when i update its firmware after update phone was sim lock, i am warried about it after some time i found a software to unlock it and then i got many software to increse its productivity and now its working fine, in the phone packeges are enough software, and main think is its camera result very good even its 2MP but its very nice result and i got some camera software that function is zoom, video recording, effects etc. and many software that is sim reader all the contact from sim readable, personilse ringtone etc if any one wana software of i phone i can provide that i have and i am try to my best contact me via mail that is haris.riaz@kesc.com.pk and haris787@hotmail.com
Is this phone really that cool? When it hits Australia I think a lot of people will be disappointed.



ï¿½Poor camera (only 2MP, no auto focus or settings)

ï¿½No Xenon flash for camera

ï¿½No choice but to use iTunes to download and transfer etc

ï¿½No video recording

ï¿½Safari browser doesn't support Flash and Java

ï¿½Poor Bluetooth capabilities

ï¿½No Office documents editor

ï¿½No third party applications (although SDK announced March 08)

ï¿½Not 3G nor HSDPA

ï¿½Phone is "hard" locked to a network

ï¿½Settings cannot be personalised (no custom ringtones allowed)

ï¿½Messaging alerts and almost any other types of alerts are fixed

ï¿½Poor loudspeaker

ï¿½Phone book does not have letter-by-letter searching of your contacts

ï¿½SIM card contacts cannot be read (contacts must be manually stored into phone)

ï¿½No MMS (picture messaging)

ï¿½Poor SMS capabilities (cannot forward SMS, no group SMS etc)



If the Iphone had

3g, EDGE , HSPDA ,GPS , GPRS



Handwriting recogonition , voice recoginition,



5 mp camera that can double up as a scanner with optical character recogonition



A small projector (that can double up as a torch) and satellite connectivity ... and one sturdy system that will not die in rain / shallow water .....WOW


You need to upgrade to 1.1.4 firmware for you to use customized ringtones. You can also customize your message alert tone by altering some files on Iphone if you are familiar with UNIX/LINUX/BSD systems remotely using SSH. Or you can access it using WINSCP (SSH using windows).

And to tell you frankly it is the only phone which a manufacturer keeps the firmware updating, meaning they develop new features using its internal operating system (like Windows).

For me Iphone is the best phone ever which other manufacturers even their upcoming models cannot offer..It is just like a computer in a pocket!

Oh and one more, there are emulators for SEGA Genesis and SNES in IPHONE!.. and they are developing emulator for PSP and PS1 in IPHONE!!! Isn't that great???? hehehe
IPHONE Rocks!..  You need not to pay for contract cause you can brought it without contract and unlock it by yourself for free. There are procedures/applications that you can easily see on the Web. At first you wonï¿½t appreciate Iphone it is just like a plain computer without any applications installed. You can optimize your Iphone that you can never imagine which I never found on other phones even the upcoming ones on the other brands.

There are 3rd party applications you can use to like SMSD and ISMS for forwarding messages and as well as use smileys better than the SEï¿½s.. Actually there are wide and various third party applications to choose from using iPhone (e.g.  if you want to copy your sim contacts, play games such as Text Twist, change themes better than SEï¿½s, VNCs remote desktop, you can access the Iphone on your computer wirelessly using the BSD System and SSH, PDF reader, GPS, file browser and lots more!,). You can even develop your own. I heard in the US some school uses Iphone and they develop a software for the students to keep them updated from their schedules, school, locate themselves in a map, etc.). Iï¿½m waiting only for the Flash player for Safari Woww!. For me Iphone has the best web browser on your pocket, no phone yet get even CLOSE. You can open multiple pages, pinch it to enlarge the page etc.. And it is a touch screen! You can sync your photo album in good quality in your IPHONE and share it with your friends! You can enlarge and view it and flip it and view the photo weather it is vertical or horizontal!  COOL! In reality you donï¿½tï¿½ need ALL features on your phone like what other has to offer, and if you use those it costs a lot of money. You only need wifi connection which Iphone has great to offer and Edge ofcourse (which I never use cause it costs a lot of money here in the Philippines). You can access your email using the built in applicatio using your iphone thru a free Wifi in a coffee shop(Starbucks). Camera? There is also an application you can use to optimize the camera. If you really need camera just buy a separate device which is real camera (itï¿½s a phone not a camera!). Videos? Wow you can watch it clearly by converting your favorite movies, mtv and sync it to your Iphone. Music? Amazing! Good playback quality! Youtube? Wow you can watch youtube as like as you are using your computer!

You need to upgrade to 1.1.4 firmware for you to use customized ringtones. You can also customize your message alert tone by altering some files on Iphone if you are familiar with UNIX/LINUX/BSD systems remotely using SSH. Or you can access it using WINSCP (SSH using windows).

And to tell you frankly it is the only phone which a manufacturer keeps the firmware updating, meaning they develop new features using its internal operating system (like Windows).

For me Iphone is the best phone ever which other manufacturers even their upcoming models cannot offer..It is just like a computer in a pocket!

u can use wetool or SMSD for forwarding sms.
why do u want everything in one fone. dont u think that they should make some business. think about nokia, samsung. what they r doing? what difference do u find in n95 and n95 8gb? why they go for new model evry after alternate day? just to attract ppl and make money.



if apple would have given everything in one fone, that to in their first initiative, then what would have left for iphone 2 (coming next june).



reserve some comments for iphone 2. pls dont lose ur patience.
Trust me people, after you buy and use an iphone, you wish you never bought it!!!

Problems:

- no (real) bluetooth - just some hardware-crippled bluetooth for expensive apple headset

- no internal gps

- "no internal gps" + "no bluetooth" = no possibility to use it for gps (now or in the future) - don't get fooled, google earth is not gps

- cannot put your mp3's or whatever as ringtones, you are stuck with some lousy defaults; after some hours of reconverting mp3s and tweaking the iphone, you can finally have some new ringtones

- no ringing profiles, just ring "on" or "off"

- no 3g

- hard to put music on, otherwise than the excessively commercial itunes

- once put on, you cannot delete or rename your music on the phone

- rather difficult to type an sms, believe me

- furthermore, making american dictionary corrections at its will, to your sms or google entry, by default; you have to edit some internal files to fix this

- you cannot turn off EDGE!! the phone spends your money on internet data in the background (without asking!), only to update the stockmarket info application or local weather

- no VOIP integration, not even some 3rd party application yet, AFAIK

- spent several nights to "jailbreak" my phone off the AT&T some time ago; finally they had to become more open

- high price when you buy it, low price when you try to sell it - because people already know some of these disadvantages

customize does not in 114 fw. 114 will do the job of customize except putting the number of icons in the dock.



amit



i think v112/3 has nothing to do with iringer. iringer will convert the songs/music in to ringtone and save in the ringtone of itune. once u sync ur fone it should go into ur fone. however, i am not sure, coz, i am in 114 and facing no problem.



thnx done...but i hv 112 version the iringer converts the mp3 but its not compitible to iphone 112...plz any one tell abt the software which can turn mp3 to iphone ringtone...thnx
Iphone is not a good phone, it's a pocket size mac that can also be used as a phone if need be making all other portable devices obsolete
hi stranger,



yah all thx to ur support!

btw, u have customize for 114 iphone? it seems if i install that, that its only for version 111/2and3 but not for 114. any thoughts?

i got soooo many other apps installed now, which didnt work for 112 before. im so happy ;)
Trust me people, when you buy and use an iphone, you will never want to have or use other phones again. This is the future at your hands. beautiful device!!
which program i should use to put any song at my iphone as ringtone ( iringer doesn't work with me ) i'm on 1.1.3



and which program to forward msgs ?



plz somebody answer me !
I agree with KxWx. I always change my phone every less than 3 months, but I think I shall use iPhone for a long time...though if it becomes too common when the tariffs gets cheaper, I would change it. Would be a pain having a phone which everyone else has.
Its still a Good Phone or shall i say *iPhone*
i m the kind og guy who will change cellnphone ever two months..but guess wat i jus promise all my friends that i will never change phone again!!as iphone is the best phone i never use..!!
it seems , stranger is master of iphone, giving all kinda solutions!!!!!!!! keep it up....................
amit



the best way of conserving battery life is to use the fone as less as possible except making and receiving calla. i charge my fone everyday cuz i use it extensively.



to add ringtone, download and install iringer in ur winxp pc. also u should be having itunes installed. find ur music from iringer. it will convert and save in itunes ringtone folder. once done, go to itune, find ringtone, check the files to be transfered and sync. remember , iringer doesnot convert all types of music format.



done



cheers
i am unable to add mp3 as ringtones..plz help me to do so & also plz tell how to save battery
I used to buy one cell every 4-6 months. Nothing ever lasted longer in my hands, because nothing was good enough.

I bought the iPhone 3 weeks ago, and the only thing I would like to say is that this phone I will keep for ever. It is not just a phone. It is a mini computer in my pocket. It is more I could ever dream off.

Just give in into it's magic and you will know what I am talking about.

iPhone and Apple rules.
???



pls read previous posts. i narrated every steps and dos and donts about upgradring. jailbreak is a method of breaking codes of ur phones that will allow u to install 3rd party applications.



be satisfied with ur present fw version. go to ziphone.org , download and install ziphone v2.6b. after that chose jailbreak only.



thats all



cheersgps absent, qwerty absent, memory unupgreadble,
wooo... genius... thx for all the information on ziphone... i go try it now... :)

chess901



go to www.ziphone.org. download ziphone (about 13 mb) in a folder where u can find it easily. once finished downloading open it/or press run. it will extract the files into a folder. create ur own folder. once done double click "ziphonegui". this will open the dialogue box for u.



u may not go through itunes/ sync ur fone. all data will be erased. before using ziphone sync ur fone. once done sync ur fone.
If you want to forward your SMS or even delete individual phone records, individual sms conversations then download and install WeTools
Add on 1 thing, I still can't find any way to forward sms... zzzz ... only can reply... I'll share with you all whenever i discover anything... :)
Dear stranger,

Hi Stranger,

I was just wondering if you know how to use the ZiPhone? Do I just plug in my iPhone and press 'Do It All'? or do I have to go through iTunes? Thx in advance Stranger!!
my bluetooth really works on my phone and the n95 rocks but vision calling is too expensive in canada jsut ask the netowrk 25 dollar plan that turns into 70 dollar debt





the n95 rocks best phone out there and i luv the look on a iphone owners face when they see the clone 150$
thats really nice that u bought an iclone,



but why didnt u buy an N95?
bought my iclone for 150$

has better features

real bluetooth

and can change ringtones to whatever i like



heres a good one for when your wife calls you put the wicked witch of the west theme works for me makes myu friends laugh
i brought IPHONE for only 399$ nyahhh
Loads of software problems with this phone,it also switches itself off which can cause you to miss calls/ messages.

You cannot forward text messages unless you rewrite it and send!

Definetely a phone to get rid of ASAP.
You can find apps such as MSN Messenger and such online thourhg google search. Just search for iPhone apps or sources and you'll find them
plz is there anyway that i can put MSN messanger on the i phone
I bought 2 days ago this iphone apple 16 gb it's an amazing mobile really smart and really nice and it's very easy to use it i like it so much and i recommend it to everybody who wants a nice,easy to use,good camera,smart phone...bye byeApart from the touchscreen and the superfast internet for such a small item Sony K850 is better than this.
hi all ...my ringtones are showing in custom not in standered ..why & plz suggest any software that can convert mp3 to iphone ringtones & also how to make ringtones in standered
I like the phone very much. But why am not buying is just because it cant use for bluetooth file transfer. i heard softwares are available for that. if any one knows about that,please let me know.my email address is mohamed.musthafa@kbr.com. Am even ready to pay for you
ive never kept a phone this long..usually jus change phones every 2 3 months buh this one its been since dec n still hab it..LOVE THIS PHONE!! n dunt plan on changing phnones annnyyyy time soon for a whileeeee
theres no reason why it woudnt work

check youtube and search for a video that shows messenger on a iphone

(make sure its not the iclone ) (see the signs?) but i think its possible not probable
msn messenger is windows



apple applications are mac



the same reason its not avalible in canada

nor will it ever be avalible in canada nor will all its functions work unfourtunatly
My iphone gets too warm for comfort during calls.Any idea what to do to stop that.
please can any 1 tell me can i download mns messanger on the iphone
i doesn't mean i want to download video



i mean watch video on safari !!
for the videos i think it would be to obtain a video through itunes then load it but ive heard that theres no video recorder on this handset so...

guys no phone is perfect this is

the first iphone its riddled with issues but

its still an amazing device one thing i agree with is the bluetooth that doesnt allow you to download music from other people as music is extremly hard to make

and the artists deserve their money look in a year or less a new iphone will come out and it will be better than this but for now this is good for a start

hii



i want to ask how to play videos on my iphone from any site , i know that if it play quicktime videos ?



if any one knows any site that works at iphone or any site that plays quicktime videos plz tell me what is it .



thx

how can i put my contacts to the outlook ?



i put my contact on the computer but then what , i want to put them at my iphone !!
The iphone is very bulky and worse, it's display is prone to scratches!
Hi guys!!!

Iphone is the best phone ! My friend only for you , check this site : www.iphone.ru

Dear Experts

PLease tell me a website where I can download Games & Applications for my i-phone?? How to install the games and application in the i-phone.??
i have been using the iphone since january and would like to tell you some of the characteristics of this phone which have left me with just half of my hair...mostly because of me pulling them out in agony and frustration. wen steve jobs gave his key note speech he promised a great internet device, a phone and an ipod in one. it seems he started on the right track but somewhere down the line he just said..eeh can't be bothered no more. so as a disgruntled iphone users i would like to tell you some facts which surprisingly no review gives.

first the internet. i live in india so m not blessed with 3G as of now so I have to make my peace with EDGE. I must say its got one of the fastest browsers but what in the good lords name is the point if you can't save anything to the disk. you do not have the liberty to send files from your computer to the phone coz A. the bluetooth is meant only for A2DP and B. you cannot have attachments in your emails...yes no attachments. nor can you save opened ones. no normal person can use this phone to access internet on his laptop. so apparently have to create a secured shell first.



the phone. one of the most annoying phone interfaces i have ever seen. now say my cell number is 9800000000 and when i give it to you, you will save it as that. but when i call you your phone will show +919800000000 (incl. country code). the phone is incapable of distinguishing betwen the two. you can only reply to a text msg and not forward it. you can only send a text to one person at a time, no multiple recepients. you would think that you would just copy the message and paste it everytime for every recipient but i am sorry you can not copy anything. the predictive text is a night mare. the contact browsing a joke.



lastly the ipod. the ipod i guess is pretty much the same as the itouch but imagine that with a normal phones battery...oh dear!! the 3.5mm jack has been so built that only devices with a straight adapter can be plugged in. if your earphone has an 'L' shaped one then tough luck.

these are just some of the things which have made me miss my old xda exec ever so much. a 100gms less and that phone would be a dream machine. and by the way contrary to popular belief the iphone hangs..a lot. it seems then that apple users live in an ideal world which is governed by the limitations of its devices.
dose it has navigation? thanks...



yep it works also in the Philippines (smart/globe/sun)well i have had been using the iphone (1.1.4) for about two weeks now, it has great multi touch interface, the camera is good and web browsing is better than PDA's with WM. the down side is that it depends on the Wi Fi in meny functions. and the sound of the ring tone is low.
will bose triport earphones work with this phone.
can i use 80 gb classic's connecter cable to dock on i phone ..plz suggest
3G will be dead when wifi takes over!



Get an i-phone
apple im tempted to get the sony ericsson xperia because its 3g which totally destroys edge lol

why cant u bring an iphone out in 3g

i would change my mind straight away and by it tomozi

cuuuummmm on

to hell wit 2g
thx " stranger "



but i want another site than youtube to watch videos !1
anas



try mxtube, it will download and save and play youtube vdo directly in ur fone
Greetings readers,

I'm an Apple fanatic and a proud Apple iPhone owner to be. I'm gonna get one in 2 days time and I've seen it working as a coupla friends have already got it after consulting me. I seem to believe that this is the most brilliantly designed and marketed products in the whole wide world in terms of technology.

Yes it has its shortcoming, as does any mobile phone. The simple reason for APL to not let Bluetooth for file transfer is to encourage people to use iTunes to share and transfer files and thereby grow the iTunes awareness... it is a business perspective.... and for slightly lazy people this seems to be a pain in the wrong place...tough...!

- overall the experience that I've got out of using friends' iPhones and expectations for my new one coming in soon is way beyond what I thought it would be. It is truly a marvel and a history maker...



iPhone and Apple ROCK...

regards,

Sidh...
I suggest that you guys try Jabra brand of Bluetooth headsets for Iphone, I have one and it works great with iphone. sound and easy to use.
Easyway to make and copy ringtones to iphone is to use a software called iphone ringtone maker. It makes the ringtone and copies it directly into the Iphone a cool software and no need to use itunes.
Is this mobile screen rely scratch proof?
This gadget is everything but the phone.. it has no "real phone" functionality what's so ever.. it's meant to be an ipod with call/answer/text functionality.. camera=sux, user interface costumization=sux,3g=no,size=wide.. etc
To Revenant



pay so much money?.. I didn't find it expensive for 8GB capacity, vivid large touch screen, excellent browser and email app.. work straight from the box huh like other brand which after you put it out can't do anything more than that. with iPhone something made possible because of third party apps. think about it
my iphone is letting me down...
please help me,how can i copy my favourite songs on my pc in my phone?thanks
to Revenant:



Have you ever used an Apple product?



Sure you could buy something at a cheaper price, and it may seem to do the same if not more, but the ease of use and overall experience is worth the "supposed" premium.



You say you want it to work out of the box, why is it then that I must install virus/spyware protection onto a pc so as not to have to do complete reinstall after every time I use the internet.



Over the last 7 years of owning a mobile phone, I have to say that the iPhone is the best and most exciting experience I've had.

No crashes, and this is because the system is locked, it means it does exactly as advertised with no problems.

No 3G, not been a problem. No card slot, 8GB is plenty for almost any journey.



Thanks

God
@ the person 3 posts below



Perhaps people are complaining about the iPhone simply BECAUSE you have to optimise it to make the most of it.  Personally, I feel that when you're paying so much money for a high end phone, I want it to work straight out of the box.  I'm not interested in having to jailbreak or mod or unlock or any of the other nonsense that you need to do to the iPhone to make it anywhere even close to a competitor to the other high-end mobiles.



Fair enough, it's great for internet browsingl but that's about it.  And if that's all you're doing, buy a PC or a PDA.  Plenty of hype - total and complete failure to deliver.  Sounds like an Apple product to me...
hi anon... i can help you work your phone..
iphone really really rocks!! lol I don't know why and how people keep posting that it is a "piece crap." Well, those people, i can say they don't know how to optimize their iPhone or even use whahahaha
i want to ask how to play videos on my iphone from any site , i know that it play at quicktime format ?



if any one knows any site that works at iphone or any site that plays quicktime videos plz tell me what is it .



( to watch videos , i know theres youtube but i want something else )



waiting for answer
I own a Nokia N82, N95, an HTC Prophet and an iphone.

I was skeptical about it but once i got it, let me tell you, i HATE Apple normally but this phone is revolutionary. Never had such a user friendly phone. really really easy to use. Could do with a better camera or a GPS but id rather have an easy to use flashy phone with less features rather than a 'typical' looking phone with a crapload of features which can be used after clicking through a couple of buttons.



On the iphone, nomatter what i want..click home, and tap on screen and BAM im there.
I wish I can remote my linux,unix, and windows using PALM TREO and connect to VPN.. =P nice hahaha
I've seen one today and the guy who had it was very unsatisfied... Actually, he uses it just to access the internet, because he says that the iPhone as mobile phone sucks.

When I have shown him my Palm, he asked where he could get one and get rid of the iPhone. :D



So, if you ask me - PALM TREO is the best mobile phone ever and the iPhone is just a very expensive, though nice looking, toy.
better than blackberry.? nope sorry im not a little kid ima business man...
OMG! Can't believe the power of its OS. wow! IPHONE is the best phone ever!


http://www.apple.com/pr/librar...6iphone.html


For an IT personnel (and as well as endusers), you can remote/administer your computers,servers (unix,linux via ssh/VNC over windows) via IPHONE. ILO via IPhone's Safari (view status, restart, shutdown, configure). View corporate email via Iphone's Safari. What could you ask for?.. Brilliant device!
The battery,getting ringtones&bluetooth are all big drawback to this phone.
the no 1!i use it for more then 2 months and i have no regret'you can have mms you can read txt pdf whits some online programs soon will be flash' and at the last 3g.allmost perfect!my special thangs too comunity sources ho work hard to make the perfect device

There seems to be a lot of discussions concerning, whether iPhone beats Nokia N-series etc etc. I've had some of N-series phones, N73, N80, N95, N958GB, and they are brilliant phones and I loved using them, but iPhone is something different in my opinion, and I would not trade it for anything else.



However, I would generally, NOT recommend iPhone to a buyer because of its many flaws. Like some people say, with iPhone either you love it or hate it, and to be frank, if you love it, then you would pay a ridiculous sum to have it. That's life.



And also, LG PRADA does not cost more than Viewty, and since when did they?! Prada was going downhill from around ï¿½270 mark when Viewty was selling at around ï¿½350. I don't know if the market has changed now since it's been a while Viewty's out but I doubt LG PRADA, the outdated phone costs more.
@ Person talking about when iphone is coming



I work for Vodafone actually, and our N95 is still $1049 outright. Also we are not getting the iphone until the 3G version is realeased later on in the year
Well if I must say so myself it does look snazzy doesn't it.



BUT... Is it really worth it?



Well it looks nice. So do alot of phones. For a phone that is made to be a music and entertainement phone it doesn't have many good debateable points does it? I am still in awe a phone like this does not have 3G and for the price it is do not think that good looks make it worth it. Take the Prada and LG Viewty for instance, both touch screens, both LG. The Prada is more expensive than the Viewty even though the Viewty has a 5mp camera and the Prada only 2. The Viewty also has 120 FPS video recording, which Prada does not. So really ask yourself, what ARE you paying for? Because it seems to me you are paying for a phone that says "iphone" from a company that fail at making a computer system even half as decent as Windows.

hi i hv got one but i wana 2 use one 4 home & another at office thats why i am asking will the connecter works ?
this is the best phone in the world. I am a corporate gsm phone dealer, and this is WAY better than Blackberry, any Nokias/sonyericssons or anything else on the market.



People who say bad things about this phone are usually just jelous because they cant afford one.



Not one person who sees the phone in the flesh can say anything bad about it because they all want one!



The only thing bad is the no mms - who cares about lack of 3g? The wireless data charges are ridiculous anyway - i have cable internet at home, and the iphone gets websites fast enuff.



No comparison - Best phone EVER!



iphone lover









u need some help..serious help..





"this is the best phone in the world. I am a corporate gsm phone dealer, and this is WAY better than Blackberry, any Nokias/sonyericssons or anything else on the market."





ORLY? over what does it beat the n95 8gb,n82,xperia other than the touch screen?





"People who say bad things about this phone are usually just jelous because they cant afford one."







i could afford one and still can, but why would i buy something which doesnt excel in anything when i can get a n95 8gb?







"Not one person who sees the phone in the flesh can say anything bad about it because they all want one!"







my friend has one..and he knows its bad,i know its bad,and i dont want one..why would i want a mobile phone that fails?







"The only thing bad is the no mms - who cares about lack of 3g? The wireless data charges are ridiculous anyway - i have cable internet at home, and the iphone gets websites fast enuff."





alot of people care about the lack of 3g,why do u think 99% of high end mobiles have 3g?







"No comparison - Best phone EVER!"



actually theres no comparison cuz noone wants to make a phone that is as bad at this so called "phone".





it look's great...but i have one question: does it suport pdf or doc(word) files...?
the iphone was never intended for 3g networks people there lots of issues with it the iphone is mac itunes is a big issue here do you know how many systems would have to be combatible with mac to run this monstrosity? stop complaing this was a start of something big

hey corporate dealer

can i use (mail) hotmail , i made one at yahoo but i want hotmail , could i ?hey just wanted to know how to get new ringtones in my iphone?? like i tried getting them by ibrickr but it just not works...
Im with ATT about 10 years ( Before Cingular) and i had allot of phones, as, Razr, Nokia, LG, and more..I never get Voicemail before, without ringing my phone..But now, I have Iphone, and most time im receiving Voice mail without Any ringing my phone..Im sure iphone signal more bad than other phones, i mean FHZ..About this problem i change 3 iphones, but still same..I reported to Apple and ATT, they say we will fix that soon...lol
Without WIFI, you will wait to long for open you web when you on EDGE...This is very bad..Today's AT&T 99% phones has a 3G, but why they won 3G on Iphone we don't understand..Im sure soon most iphone users will sell them phone if no 3G, because Iphones EDGE saks and very saks...Razr phone or nokia phones has EDGE too, but they are ok, but iphone working very bad with EDGE..
Gr8 phone if u use all its application! !!!! gr8 use jailbreaker aswell!!!!!!!!!!!
I see people are still arguing about how "shit" iPhone is compared to its functionality and price, and that it's just a "pretty face". But in terms of anything we buy, we pay for the label, the fashion, the materials etc etc, and not just its functionality. Why can't they get the idea that some don't want EVERYTHING in a phone, but want something they feel comfortable and something they appreciate. I mean Vertu costs more than an average car, but its functions are close to being that of 6 or 7 years ago. So stop trying to preach everyone here that iPhone is worthless because it's expensive for nothing.
Someone commented about the iPhone not having 3G and thus not being able to send MMS.



You don't need a 3G phone to use MMS.



I'm using a Blackberry and it's only GSM but can still send and receive multimedia messages. I'm upgrading to the iPhone soon. Can't wait!!
I am using the iphone 8GB 1.1.4 for two weeks now and I am very happy with it. It was much much easier to set it up on my house WiFi than my new Toshiba State of the Art Notebook. I love the software installation and uninstalling system. screen is great, touch system is yop class and brightness is the best in the market.

It is so easy to use and play with even your kids can do it. This is the best tool I have had.
Its pretty cool compared to its competition Nokia nN81

I din't like the phone. Of course it is sleak and slim but on the functionalities it lacks a lot. It has only SMS and e-mail, MMS is available by a third party app. It has an average camera. It has an average battery life. I didn't like it at all and I sent it back. Right now i am into smartphones but i would not change it with a SE K850i.
is it true that a 3G version of iphone will soon emerge?
to stranger:



fair enough, i will admit you know more than i do. lets wait and see then...Can Apple turn potential into actuality? June 8th will tell
some body tell me about this phone !

its price

its camera result

and more
Do NOT buy iPhone because you CANNOT send a file by bluetooth!

hi. nice comments.

do u remember when the top cellphone makers made their prototype fones? perhaps, u were surprised to see such a wonderful device that could connect u wirelessly from anywhere. think about nokia 3110 (for example) and latest nokia n96. as we have gathered vivid knowledge about the functionalities of cell fones, we make a lot of comments which may not have been made.

apple has come up with their first venture of iphone. dont u think that they knew the latest technology in 2007. yes, they knew.



a trading house always, gradually, comes out with their better products. apple did the same.



u will be surprised to see the next iphone in june 08.



if everything was included in iphone-1, then what would been left for iphone-2.



apple will make everyone the happiest with their 2nd venture. wait n see.
apparently our friendly neighourhood

gsm provider here in canadas media player only functions on windows xp so

this can lead to a conflist with having it on as a network phone too bad by the time it can fixed this will be old news great phone though
ps, one more thing, when you iphone lovers make comments on other touch devices on this site and others, please please please stop refering to them as wannabe iphone-killers. trust me, comparing them to the iphone means they are on the same level, dont degrade these new handsets by making that insinuation... iphone killers ....lol. nothing to compete against
to stranger:

here is another solution to the problems:

BUY A GOOD PHONE THAT ACTUALLY HAS SOME FORM OF FUNCTIONALITY OUTSIDE A PRETTY FACE.

thats all the iphone is, a pretty face, but on the inside its as shallow as the spoilt girl next door.



and before any of you apple groupies start to talk, hit the compare link and compare this fone to any other touch device released between now and 2 years ago, i assure you they will outperform this ipod that can make calls.



i cannot believe people actually let flashy advertising and brand names actually coerce them into spending so much for so little geez!



for actually functionality, samsung, toshiba and lg have released some okay handsets, i admit they dont have the good interface of the iphone, but they make up for it with functionality- proper cameras, browsing and by far superior multimedia capabilities.
anynews about 3G iPhone????amit



once u have written, just press home button. u will go back to the main screen. why dont u answer all the questions.



have u configured ur sim from ur service provider or it is already done before u buy it.



u dont need to write user name and password
stranger one more thing my apn address is www.a.ru

but even i put if its not working...any other setting to do with this
richo



whatever u install in ur fone, u will also find it in the uninstall of installer, giving u an option to uninstall. this is ok.



why do u need to install chinese language. it is suppossed to be preinstalled. my fone has this.



check ur fone, go to setting, general, choose international, choose asian fonts, u will see japanese and chinese options. try it, may be helpful.



ziphone is also available in chinese language.
thnx stranger b4 iphoe i use nokia n95 ...but what do u mean by main page anf home ..plz reply
amit,



answer following questions:



1. which fone u used to use before iphone and how u configured ur internet?



2. what is the apn address provided by ur operator.



ok, now go to setting, then to general, then network.



at the bottom find EDGE, click it



find the page EDGE setting, there u see APN. write ur APN address. for example i use "Grameen Phone" in one of the south asian country. the service provider has given me the APN address as "gpinternet, gpmms, gpwap. i use only gpinternet. once  written go back to ur main page anf home.



before that u must ensure that u r subscribed to ur service provider for ur services.



amit, it's easy. may be u r not acquinted with the procedure. why dont u go to the customer service.



again, buy a wi-fi, and use ur internet connection at home.
richo



hi.



ziphone v3.0 has been released. get it and install. it's a great work. it auto downgrade bb 4.6 to 3.9.



cheers.
stranger plz help me



plz anyone can tell me step by step setting for gprs...coz i hv the setting but i dont know how to set gprs connection



stranger,





thank you for your information, I'm busy pass few weeks, therefore did not come bac here to rpy...





After search through all your post to find details on jailbreak, I still hv some doubts, vry sry if asking some repeating question as I really can't hv much time to read all post 1 by 1...





My iphone upgraded to v1.1.4 thru iTunes, I'm not sure about my bb version.. hw to check? if higher than 3.9, is ziphone can help to downgrade?





So to jailbreak, first is install ziphone on my pc, then confirm bb version, then click "do it all"??





I need chinese language, which a s/w call NativeCn. But after upgrade to v1.1.4, the NativeCn move to uninstall list (in a s/w call Installer), is it means its not support by v1.1.4?





Stranger, I really need your precious experience on jailbreak iphone... without jailbreak, this phone is really suck...
Can someone please tell me the difference between the iPhone 8gb and 16gb?
plz anyone can tell me step by step setting for gprs...coz i hv the setting but i dont know how to set gprs connection
Really love this phone

at first i read the specs and i'm pretty disappointed but after about 2 days you get really attached and its really quite user friendly
iphone user same as blackberry user only worried obout what they look like using the mentioned handsets sad really material world we live in
as an artist i think bluetooth a crime to steal music do you honestly know how hard some work to make just one hit song?

some wpend their whole life building it

its like a painting you cant copy that

you can make a poster itll never be real

people will steal whatever they can to save money
I can give you some explanation about Iphone or other phones...

If you go Club, and you see there is 2 girls, one of them very nice sexy, and other one little fat and not sexy, but when you talk with both, you find out sexy girl talking law class than other fat girl, i mean that fat girl has a more education than that sexy girl..So, im sure you will go with sexy and nice girl and not with fat girl..

So this is same as Iphone and N95...Iphone looks sexy and nice, but when you go inside, you can see noting special, but when you go N95, you can see allot of programs and options...
i'll tell u why people are complaining about BLUETOOTH file transfer



BLUETOOTH is the number 1 way most people get songs, videos, images on to there phone(btw its free)



but this aint the only reason why the iphone sucks



so think twice before purchase



get a NOKIA(n series) or better yet wait for the highly anticipated nokia tube (codename) which is basically the same thing but has everything the iphone lacks e.g. decent camera, video recorder, 3g, etc.



peace out:D
I don't understand why people complain about the lack of bluetooth transfer with the computer. BT is extremely slow and useless, if you transfer many songs, movies, games etc. USB 2.0 is enough.

@RK:

no, apple iphone isnt capable of sending data files via bluetooth to any other devices. the only connection you can make is via internet (lightning speed wifi or turtle-ish gprs) and data cable (sync via itunes only, sucks huh).

and apple iphone doesnt support any third party application in the world. so, no. your there is no solution to the bluetooth data transfer dilemma.



no it doesnt have any saving, draft writing, or even forwarding messages feature. all messages are displayed in a chat-like interface, where your sent items to that one friend is shown on one side of the screen, whilst what your friend says is shown on the other side. so when you delete a message, whatever you have ever sent to that one friend (or whatever that one friend have ever said to you), goes along with it.



but on the other hand, graphics, haptics, screen resolution, and accelerometer is great. but sorry to tell you the loudspeakers suck.
looks years ahead, but sucks years behind. doesnt have a chance to win my support unless they fit in features like the latest nseries does. people need personalisation, and thats something apple is not giving us.
bought this ph a week back.i think my money just went dwn d drain.nothin great abt this phone.dont waste ur money guys...either wait for a better and refined model from apple or just stick to whateva u have coz iam goin back to my p990i.
I just got the 8GB version of iPhone and am awestruck by its brilliant design and user experience.



iPhone takes the following features on a mobile phone, to a higher plane... be it browsing the net, watching videos, listening to podcasts, listening to music...



thanks to the large 320 x 480 pixels, 3.5"" display, even the photos taken with its minimal 2MP cam look great on a full screen mode.



wifi, edge and gprs are good enough for connectivity.



well there are some drawbacks, but loadsa hacks are available to enable mms, voice mail play games and so on and so forth.



not sure why apple is not enabling these features by default.



and if you are a designer, i recommend this phone to you.



cheersThe news of a 3g iphone is currently not true, at the earlest time the 3g iphone will be out in april 09 in the usa and then in september 09 in the uk.



There is no word on what networks will have the iphone 3g because AT&T and O2 have the contract on the "Iphone" not the "Iphone 3g"

i will update asap.
NEWS FLASH!



as of 16/04/08 the iphone in the uk will be reduced by ï¿½100 to ï¿½169. I can promise you this IS going to happen!



Get the money at the ready!

richo



ur worry is over.



iCosmo (native cn) now supports 1.1.4 properly, so just add the repositories/sources mentioned below, and go to localization in installer, install icosta, reboot, and you are all good.





cheers, cheers
Richo,





ur chinese input vanished, bcoz that was made for 1.1.2 or below.

i could find some unhappy solutions for you. u need to wait a little. the repositors will soon bring out the native cn for 114 version.

however u can go ahead as described below, and wait and one day after refresh u will find our native chinese language for fw 114.

now below the steps for 112 or below.



1. Add iphone.org.hk/repository.plist to installer sources

2. Then add iphone.freecoder.org/rep to installer sources

3. Then add app.weiphone.com/installer to installer sources



4. Install BSD Subsystem.



If u want to type in Chinese (but use English for the interface) install

iCosta Pinyin



If u want to type in Chinese (and have the phone in chinese) install

WeFit.



There are 2 decent chinese input methods

NativeCN, and iCosta.



pls wait never mind.

post made by below is too complicated. at one time u will lose track. the simplest way of getting internet connection via wi-fi and install all ur fav software.



now how to get wi-fi connection? there also could be wireless LAN in ur areas. if not buy a Linksys (china made, less costly, about 60-70 us $) wireless-G router. push into the broadband line behind it, and take out another line and connect with ur pc. switch on the wi-fi.



go to setting of ur fone, find network, swith the on button of wi-fi to on. go back to main. u will see the connection symbol on the top in the status bar.  u r connected.



now browse. if ur office has any wi-fi LAN, u can also use that. some railway  station or airport also has wi-fi free to use. u can also use that. or if ur neighbour has the same within about 100 metre, that can also be used, but this is illegal to use without his permission.



check out.





richo,



{i never did it}



If you wanted to install third-party native software in your iPhone but you didn't had the necessary technical knowledge or courage, the newly updated iPhone Installer.app will make it easy.this has been tried in Mac OS X.

Once you download the application , you only have to connect your iPhone to your Mac (PowerPC and Intel will work) and run the script from the Mac OS X Terminal.



Preparation

ï¿½ Download the installation file to your desktop.

ï¿½ Connect your iPhone to your computer using the provided cable.

ï¿½ Deactivate the iPhone automatic synchronization in iTunes before proceeding and close iTunes.



Steps

ï¿½ Go to Utilities in your Applications folder and find Terminal.

ï¿½ Double-click on Terminal.

ï¿½ In the Terminal, go to the folder that contains the application installation script. You can easily do this by typing cd in the command line, then space, then dragging the iPhoneInstaller folder into the Terminal Window. This will automatically paste the path in the Terminal. If you saved the iPhoneInstaller folder to your desktop like we told you, it will look something like this:

cd /Users/your_user_name/Desktop/iPhoneInstaller/

Hit the return key to change to that folder.

ï¿½ Now run the script, which is called get_installer.sh, by typing the following:

./get_installer.sh

ï¿½ The script will now run, asking you what version of firmware do you have. If you updated your iPhone, you will have 1.0.1. If not, select 1.0 by typing the option.

ï¿½ The script will automatically download the necessary restore file from the Apple servers.

ï¿½ When it's done, it will prompt you to hold the home button (with the square) and the power button (on the top) at the same time (hold first the home, then hold the power).

ï¿½ When the message "Connect to iTunes" appear in your iPhone, release the buttons and let the thing do its magic.



The iPhone will restart and you will find a new icon in your home screen.





i am afraid, if u can do it correctly. i again suggest u to do using wi-fi. it's easy and simple.
richo



u must be using wi-fi in ur office/home. i am not sure/or not tried yet whether u can install from itune. wi-fi is the best solution. using edge will be costly and time consuming. if u have wi-fi, get connected via it and enjoy the best.



the version of native chn language may have supported 114. but it shouldn't have happened. i need to examine it more. may be at later time.



i am available on working days between 0200 am-0800 am GMT and 1:00 pm 6:00 pm GMT.
Stranger,



Thx for all ur advice and explanation... appreciate vry much... I'll start trying to install s/w... :)

richo



ur fone has 2 partitions. one is of 300 mb out of 8 gb and rest are for common use. the 300 mb drive takes the fw 114 and the "exe/ini" files of the installed softwares. when u see from the itune u can see that the memory showing is about 7.27 gb. yes, ur songs, photos, vdos are saved in larger drive of 7.27 gb.



if u r confident in using ur fone, u can install boss tool and use it to relocate ur fonts from small memory to large memory. this will give u more than 100 mb of free space in the 300 mb drive. but be careful, this is likely to make fone unstable at times.



richo



some of the nice softwares will require "bsd subsystem". if u r desperate, u have to install bsd ss. otherwise, for few installations install "fake bsd subsystem". this will allow u to install software like "boss tool" (needed to see the memory left). good and required software that u will need are:



snapture

MiM

showtime

wedict including wordnet, britanica

wetool

mms

wallpaper

sketch

real artist

3reel (game)

pianist

books

summerboard

pool

icontact/isim





i havent installed bsd ss. once u install it u cannot delete it.
Stranger,



yes, i'm using ziphone v3. but i abit confuse on 300MB? my iphone is 8GB (actually oni 7.3GB), nw available 6.8GB... I forgot hw much songs I've put in... but probably won't used up 500MB... so maybe is ziphone v3 install extra some app..



btw, the chinese s/w is for me to type chinese in SMS... btw, b4 i upgrade the 1.1.4, originally this phone come with NativeCn 3.10a which suppose to support by 1.1.4, but I'm nt sure why after the technician unlock my phone (last time), the NativeCn icon is gone... remain only in uninstall list. juz nw using ziphone to "do it all", now its totally removed... =.=" ...



btw, hw to install an application into iphone? through itune, drag & drop to iphone list??
richo



most of the softwares are free. to get the softwares, u need to install the sources. install all the sources whatever u get from installer of ste packaging. besides, install all sources. proceed as follows:



go to installer, press "sources", press "edit", press "add". write "ride4.org/shai.xml" then press ok. it will take some time. once done, browse the installer. there u will find a lot of softwares, find "sources" and install "all sources" . it will install about 107 sources. have patience.



once done, browse "all packages", choose ur one and install. u should delete some of the sources those r of other languages. this will reduce ur subsequent refresh time.



will come back with more suggestions



cheers
Oh by the way, I hv include my email add, juz in case if using email is better than post out here... :)



Thx 4 ur support all the times... :) ... its ok d... coz juz nw i really panic... juz when i plan to call the technician, i suddenly remember there is one post mention on how to reset the iphone... so i juz try it out... and it works! so i juz click "do it all" again in ziphone and this time vry smooth...
richo



did u use ziphone v3? it's fine. u could also use ziphone 2.6b. v3 takes a lot of space from ur 300 mb memory. once u do it u r left with about 39 mb of space. bcuz v3 installs bsd subsystem, openn ssh and installer; but v 2.6b installs only installer and u find 54 mb of space.



do not install too many softwares, some of the software will hang ur fone, like "one touch".
Stranger,



In one of ur prev post, u hv list down a lot of apps add extra functions eg: iSMS, iRingtone..etc



Can you share to me where can you get those s/w? is it freeware of shareware?



many thanks.
richo,



why do u need to send to technician???



i posted before that this fone has a very strong heart, generally, it will not die.



what exact problem u r facing now??to all



Chinese have developed a handwriting recognition app for the iPhone.



Still in beta, Latin and Chinese characters are both recognized, and the input is currently done with the finger. Of course you could also use the Pogo Stylus or TapRight as well, if you're more of a stylus folk.



Currently, the only way to get HWPen is to add iphonecake.com/src/all as a source in your Installer and grab it from there.



it's a good program, i tested.
just bought it. Its VERY good. Amazing interface.

i was afraid of the touchscreen that doesnt have a stylus... (even with fingernails)...



Some things are not good like the auto-correction on the sms but you can remove it.

there are a lot of things to install.



my recommendation... try it before you buy it,

thats what i did. i tried the htc dual and the iphone... what i didnt like with htc was the small letters on the screen... you must always use the stylus



iphone its like holding a small tv.

worths the money...

does the iphone work in australia? on australian networks??
I have iphone dummy phone! only for show!
@ jailbreaker



as i told everyone the iphone is now 169 in the uk, from carphone warehouse and O2.



Trust in me!

this phone in the USA is:

-$400 for 8gb

-$500 for 16gb

-these prices are for only AT&T locked phones offered by Apple themselves.

-unlock phone prices may vary



i am not sure of the price outside of the USA.
Please tell me is it benificial to buy i phone............

To All Iphone Lovers and Users,



It is about battery charge cycles of iphone. The iPhone battery has about 400 cycles. That does NOT mean it can only go on the charger 400 times. It means if lets say you use up 25% of your battery one day. You go home and charge. That is only a .25 charge cycle. Next day you use 50% and go home and charge. That is a .50 charge cycle. So, so far only did .75 over all. Next day you do 75% drain from playing around all day on it. Then go home and charge. Now you used 1.5 cycles so far.



Average use (once you get over new factor) is at most I would say 50% usage in a day. That means if you charged it full each night, it will take 800 nights. Thus over two years of charging.



Iphone users must be happy now, but I am.
Perhaps he meant XDA.
can anyone tell me what exactly is 320*480 in apple iphone, and also suggest me whether to go forward and purchase that mobile.



Thanks in advancemobile news mag (17/4/08)



"nokia looking to move into the laptop Market due to apples massive success into the moble Market"



Nokias MD olavi toivainen said " no one can say apple have not made a great Market changing phone, so we must learn from what apple have shown us. You will see the release of the nokia tube early next year and we are thinking about a move into the laptop Market"



Even nokia see the iPhone as a great product, a threat done would say.



So these comments from people who clearly have never used and iPhone stop making yourselves look foolish and buy an iPhone!
iPhone is bad phone for canada, it never works when you need it to, it shuts down, have to keep getting it unlocked all the time, and it has NO GPS still!!! this phone is over priced garbage, i bought it and sold it the next week. stay away from this phone its only causes problems in Canada
I think most of the people who gave opinion here, never played this device. They just read through hardware configuration and gave opinion. Who ever used iPhone's safari or touch UI, will never look back to any other kind of  phone. People can't understand that iPhone is all about Software, it's about user satisfaction. I used Windows Mobile, Nokia N95, SE W950 and SE P910i in last 2 years. After getting iPhone it seems i was in jungle for last few years and now I've come to modern city.

iPhone Rocks....
hi

i had been following the iphone fairytale for some time ,so i finally decided to check it out myself my previous phone was htc touch ,now shifted to iphone

my advice to all future iphone buyers is that if ur buying this phone for fun then ur going to love it.

(but its no way near any higher end PDA's)in features .
firstly to all people who dont seem to think this phone has bluetooth, your wrong, it does.



Its way ahead of the touch as it has a camera and speakers.



In response to Adolf, the camera is actually not so bad and when you put it into its dock on itunes the photos can be saved and stored far quicker than any memory card or usb from a normal phone,this is way better.



I actually work for O2 as a business manager, I own two blackberries and they are awesome, but when it comes to pure style and fun along with ease of use and to have my music in ipod format whenever i go, the iphone absolutely batters everyone.



It truly has to be owned to appreciate the quality and right now you can get them ï¿½100 off!! so go get one!! offer ends June 1st.



cheers



Never buy first-issue models from any phone maker if don't wanna be disappointed. Just wait until they give it some more features that will at least meet your tekky requirements.. As for me, i'll just wait till iPhone's equipped with a better camera and 3.5mm jack and bluetooth A2dp. And uhmm vga video capture capability at least. Lolz
Note that the iPhone headphone jack is not 3.5mm as mentioned by GSM Arena, but it's proprietary, please correct this GA.
iPhone is a phone that shock the whole world and the whole mobile phone industry. No wonder every phone maker is trying to kill iPhone. Palm is for ever struggling after iPhone launch, nokia and Sony samsung are trying to kill iPhone. Now everybody realise that the design and usability surpass the functionality. Apple is gaining popularity while windows is struggling with the vista.



--from my iPhone , I am a experienced wm user
this cellphone looks awful becuz of its design
apple iphone is amazing i feel in love as soon a caressed its silver backing pads. i almost got off
this phone is about vanity, extravagance and most of all waste of money!
this phone is rubbish.

no bluetooth,abysmal camera, storage system prone to failures - I have already changed 4 of them!!!!! I'll get a Blackberry now, they are much better and stable.

I think that the only very spoilt children with lots of money could love this bad phone.

Not to mention that those who love it have no technical knowledge at all.

I hate it.
I was thinking of buying this but when I found out that there is no video recording, i changed my mind. I was also hesitating on buying this when I heard there's no bluetooth.



I guess u don't know much about the iphone then. u can download all those rubbish widgets on the iod touch too. besides who needs to know about stupid stock exchange anyway
the iPhone is way better than the itouch,it has many more features and has speakers for listening to music !!!! ZoRRoW !!!!
Personnally, the iphone is a waste of money, i hav ipod touch better value for money. it's evryting except phone and camera, big deal!
My answer to Mr. Artizstic. Ever heard of jailbreakng. it allows you to download pretty much anything you want.
you can download tons of games and its very convient. you can also play games online which is also very convient!
i love you iphone
Hey does anyone know if their june version will have A2DP? Stereo bluetooth profile... if not I'm highly dissapointed.Hi,

Right naw i have nokia N95 in your opinion should i get iphone?
Well, i m planning to buy it..now im using n95...i know i ll be missing many options in aplle..but still ..!anm apple a day keeps the doctor away..!
hi i charged my iphone 4 12 hours the next  day it said no service can someone tell what that means thanks
Battery is not user replaceable. That sucks...
bluetooth is only available  for head set , any way its very high class phone but in my opinion it must be sim free for all
hi haldar



this fone is very much available in your country and it is reasonably cheap compared to n95. an unlocked and jailbroken 8gb ifone is about 550 and a 16 gb one is about 750 us $. if u have any question about this fone ask me pls.
I just got an iphone after using N95 and HTC. This is a fabulous phone with great features and very simple to use and operate. This is an unlocked version that i got and i do not understand why Apple is not launching the official version as yet in India. Sound and picture quality are great. And yes you can forward SMS messages after downloading an application to make it happen. I would strongly suggest that you go for the iphone!
does any one no how to use bluetooth on here?
the phone has nothing good other than interface,size.

its features practically suck and is very expensive to buy
nice phone.user friendly.    =)
We leave in Bangladesh so pls start selling this nice phone to our country.
i've got one and i'm pleased with it,
Well I Must Say That Its A Nice Phone,But Sometimes It Iritates A Lot B,coz If I'm Riding A bike So At That Time I Cann't Use It.But I'm Quite Satisfied.
i've read many comments abt iphone, both pros and cons, you have ur points.



the worst thing i hate with this is its very* sleek shape. its very uncomfortable, as if it would fall out from my hands every time i'm holding it.
Iphone is one of the greatest phone made.. for those peeps who think tat it suck. think again. it can be constantly updated and u wont have to change a phone. and software can be downloaded this camera is without a zoom but after dling software it can be zoomed how cool is tat. full touch screen sleek body, good sensitivity its a phone tat is worth buying
Anybody knows, is there any possible game option in iPhone, or FM radio? How much comfortable using the touch screen compared to keypad? If i unlock the iphone, then is it possible to use it with full features or with comfort???
If you just google out:



"The iPhone has Bluetooth 2.0+EDR built-in, but so far it seems to carry little functionality outside use of accessories like the Apple Bluetooth headset."
hi there .

I had nokia n95 but yesterday I bought iphone.

I think iphone is much better.

I really like it very much.

very good phone
its nice only messaging is difficult due to touch screen oter wisse it is beatiful and niceI bought iphone recently,but one of its speakers doesnt work,does anybody know if it is because of one of the software or not?:-(

and woud you tell me how I can record sound and videos?

thaaaaanks
Hi dwight,



r u a new user of this fone? the shortcomings u mentioned in ur post do not exist now. all of those have been eliminated by the introduction of softwares. i am just mentioning one, the camera. install "snapture" and get all whatever u want. this software is even better than any other camera software of any modern fone. try it.
i love this phone but i agree there is shortcomings and there will most likely be another much better iphone in the pipeline.



pro: memory, styling, predictive text is unrivalled on qwerty keyboard, ease of use, speed of software [no lag ever] interphase with computer is also very good, battery life for a multimedia phone is excellent.



the shortcomings:

camera, no video record, no zoom, no picture messaging, inability to save individual texts, just conversations [this is a plus however, very MSN messenger, useful for text convo's] bluetooth compatibility with other phones.



if you want a camera phone then this is obviously not for you but i wanted a stylish phone, with room for my songs, pictures, good calendar / pc sync features, very easy to use and thats what i got, can fully reccomend this phone to anyone.
hi jigmey,



have u gone thru the user manual of this device? download it and pls read.



however, have u downloaded itunes for winxp and installed? if not, pls do it. once done and connected ur fone, ur pc will auto sync the fone. and for softwares, connect ur fone thru wi-fi or ur service provider with internet. u will be prompted to all the actionc.
u r wrong my fren MMS input can be done and all appts can be done..i'm a technician of iphone...unlocked and input appts... MMS,zoom in cam,sim port,email.. and etc...check it out at my shop..LUCKY PLAZA B1-63..tommy here..
you want at&t to use the iphone?? or it is ok to use with nothing?
iPhone is new standard in hand held mobile devices. Debate why its priced so highly? Well simply because its an iPod Touch coupled with a mobile device. Lets not compare it with other windows or symbian based handets out there - its a new definition to what mobile devices can be in future. Stuff like motion sensor, proximity sensor or multi touch never existed. I think apple would definately charge a premium for this. Its a basic smartphone (not business phone) - of course it leaves you with a lot to be desired. I am using it in India (New Delhi) - bought mine from California (399$ + 30$ VAT) - works out to be 17k INR where as an 8GB ipod touch costs 17.5k INR @ iStores. So I feel the price was not exorbitantly high!

What I love about it:

- Multi Touch

- Built Quality (Screen feel solid) Better than most HTC or Dopod handsets

- Excellent 16M bright display

- Amazing UI and graphics, Does not jerk or hang

- Fast processor

- Games

- Ipod (Videos and music) Awesome sound quality

- Battery Life - Lasting me over 2 days when most windows mobile don't even last a day (I used O2 Atom Exec previously)



What I hate:

- Bluetooth cant transfer files

- Ringtones need to be purchased from iTunes

- No Search on Contacts

- No SMS forwarding

- Call Timers (Doesnt track or display time of call)

- No Delivery Reports on SMS

- No 3G (no needed in India though)



Is it over rated?

I think not. A lot of innovations in this phone are worth a mention and I think companies like Sony are watching. With the launch of Xperia X1 - Sony made it clear that they learnt a few tricks from apple iphone



Should I buy it?

Well I won't suggest you to sell off you old trust worthy Nokia. (I still have my Nokia E61i - just in case). But the experience of using this wonderful device is definitely worth it. This phone has set the benchmark higher for all other companies.



I'm quite happy with my iPhone - despite the shortfalls. The pleasure of using it is greater that the pain of missing essential features. Besides softwares out there would fix most of the basic issues in iPhone.



Cheers,

I also have a similar problem...

I can't sync it with my PC regardels of what I do...

Pocket PC that I had before (HP hx4700) was much better. :)

I think that I will return the iphone and get an ordinary phone and get my belowed ppc back to servicer. :)
i bought this iphone but in xp window couldn't use it and couldn't install any program in my iphone, it is waste money to buy like this mobile
The iphone is not for all. Its a matter of horses for course. If you like me just that uses the ipod, WiFi, internet browesr, ipod video alot & not worried about the camera or videocalling then the iphone does the work.

just like dragon heart comment, i am a user of iphone and its just plain basic phone/sms and itouch. nothing fancy. since i use itouch a lot, and coupling with basic phone/sms, i am ok with it.i wonder why my credit was running out every minute? Is it because some of the 3rd party application that i've install to my iphone connected to gprs or edge?
The 3g iphone will be released towards the end of this year.
For most of the "NO"s listed by HS below, can be solved by additional software, eg. CameraPro gives you zoom, nightmode etc, ShowTIme gives you vid recording, Squid gives files access/delete etc, Sysinfo is like ctrl+Alt+delete. I ain't got that many software installed on mine, but I'm sure there's a solution for each one of those.



Though I'm not saying iPhone doesn't have flaws, cuz it definitely does, like 3g, no transferable bluetooth etc.
I love this phone is very nice and i want to buy!! It has very good specifications! The multi-touch screen is very very nice!
I am using Iphone 8 Gb for the last three days. Browsing has been a pleasure on this phone. I am able to send mms but unable to receive mms on my iphone although the settings are ok.

any 1 knowing how to receive mms on this phone kindly update me. Also let me know what all softwares to download and what not to download.

Which is the best file explorer for the iphone.

the camera is good if the light is good as there is no flash with iphone.

why is this phone not launched in the world for all.

i am waiting for the answers.

regards to all

hi ppl,



just heard that the iphone has been discontinued in the run-up to the next iPhone.



Not sure if its true but its made it onto engadget so it could be...
I have had many nokia phone; such as 7650,6600,6630,n70,5500,n73,n73music,e50,e65,611Â­0 navigator ,and n95 8 gig, now I bought iphone in Iran in 665$,excellent phone! In may opinion iphone have 3 :::;;1- so weak ringtone2-no SMS forward 3-It might fall easley in your hand,I posted this message by iphone with wifi
this is riddled with bugs and apple dont care
lool gps is supported in every country in the world because it uses satellites which revolve aroudn the earth, not one country.



i think this phone is good looking great design and evrything. but lack of features no 3G no GPS no MMS and all basic goodies that you can find on SE and nokia but when it comes to internet browsing this is great cuz its a touch screen you can easily browse webpages using this and music is great cuz of the large memory  well if your into internet browsing and music buy this buying a phone is based upon your needs not some people there wanting to buy a phone with GPS or a WIFI but on their country GPS is not supported yet i mean thats stupid! buy a phone according on your needs if your a picture lover try nokia or SE if your an internet freak try XDA or HTC now if your a music lover try this i-phone
Louie,

There is a pre-installed program in your iPhone called INSTALLER. Tap on it and your phone will search for all available stuff you can choose from.

NOTE:  You have to be connected to EDGE or to Wi-Fi before launching the installer.
EK,

Did you jailbreak your phone yourself? If it was jailbroken by the shop where you bought it, did you upgrade your phone via iTune?

If you answer YES to either of my questions, I suggest to bring your phone to where you bought it and have the firmware redownloaded.

Good Luck.
i also have a phone with i in front and it go bang. look good and speak fine. good hearing. i look forward to mapping gps system in here and go faster on train for special disability. Can no one help?

Thanks.
does any body know how i can make to install games and programs in my iphone 1.1.4 version.
hello to the owners.

can u tell me where i can download software and other stuffs for this iPhone.

Thank U.
Buy iphone in USA and unlock it in Bangkok for USD 15. The phone is about 95% usable in ASIA. Iphone is sold in USA for USD399 (8Gb) and USd499 (16Gb). Anyone traveling to US should be able to get one.



Good Luck.,
I have it for two day. It has a much sharper and brighter display than the N95 8GB. The bad thing is that you have to install an application to copy all your sim contacts to your phone. The phone is not able to use the sim contacts by it self. It is nice. Most of the appz from the installer are boring. ALL installer games are boring. Hopefully garming is gonna make it's maps available for the iphone (via bluetooth gps)...
Very Expensive !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Â­!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
S.O.S....can the iphone work in south africa?????

My iPhone is connected to the Internet via wi-fi, but I couldn't surf the net. Whenever I open the web page, it says "Safari can't find....". This only happens where password is required. Do you guys have any solutions for this?



i wish,i wish.. if iphone got 3g. hurm..
HAha.. go die Nokia fan boy .. iphone and most of the Apple products are the best invention in the world !!!
This phone is getting so boring..

I hate it..

I had to give mine to my sister because i have nothing to do with it..my n95 and viewty have more things to do on it than this garbage.. and the camera quality is disgusting..  WOW it has a touch screen..

WHO CARES!!! my viewty has a touch screen and a 5.1 MP camera.. this doesnt even have no 3G.. Its bluetooth capabilities are just awful..oh gosh.. people are just so lame listening to this steve jobs person.. YOU'VE ALL BEEN BRAINWASHED!!
hi.

dont buy iphone phone has a too many problems.

The Apple iphone is one of the worst cell phones out there. Over millions of people have broken their iphone in mearly 2 weeks, this is because it's to fragile. This phone has the least features i've evcer seen. I would recommend the Nokia n series phones, becuase there better in thing.
not to good phone kazi has it...reallybad.
Hi to singapore uers good news 3G iphone will be release in mid jun 80 by sintel  about $690.. latest model so dont buy any export set from now ,just wait for the release ,export set very costly, only 2G and

apple do not give warranty, u cannot update latest software release by apple.
Once the iPhone gets jailbroken/unlocked, there are no limits to what it can do. Probably the best phone out there.



And we've got to admit, this simply being an Apple product makes it worth buying.



Got mine four days ago and so far it's doing great. I love it.

hi..

would you plz tel if I want to have may native language font in my iPhone ,what should I do?
if you have an iphone you should download the installer app. with this you will be able to download lots of things such as unlimited video recording with audio,  nes games, navizon (gps). i am using it and my iphone works perfectly good. its not true that iphones stop working if you jailbreak it. go to youtube.com and watch videos about the iphone and the steps are there. for example if you want to jailbreak it write- iphone jailbreak or if you want games -iphone games- etc write clue words and it will be eeasy to find anything you want to do to the iphone.
This is how you hack your iphone....

1.  No SMS delivery reports

2.  Canï¿½t recieve MMS messages

3.  Canï¿½t send or receive anything over Bluetooth

4.  2 mega pixel camera with no video. Nokia N95 has a 5 mega pixel camera and full screen video recording and tv out playback. Result.

5.  You cannot remove its battery. Thanks for replicating one of the biggest complaints about the ipod, Apple!

6.  The camera has little or no options, and the pictures it takes arenï¿½t very good.

7.  It lacks proper support for Flash websites. So much for the internet.

8.  It canï¿½t record video.

9.  No songs as ringtones

10. No GPS

11. It only allows for a maximum of 1 picture to be attached to each e-mail you send

12. It doesnï¿½t have a file browser/organizer.

13. Its default ringtones suck

14. You can not save documents on it: documents can only be viewed as attachments when theyï¿½re sent to your e-mail address

15. Heat issues: the iPhone can get very hot when it is in use.

16. Thereï¿½s no way to cut, copy, or paste text!

17. The mobile version of OS X or whatever it is the iPhone runs takes up 700MB of the deviceï¿½s capacity

18. Apple sez between 300-400 charges the iPhone will lose battery capacity ï¿½ youï¿½ll send it in and get the cell replaced for a fee

19. No expansion slot.

20. No third-party applications.

21. No voice dialing.
TeleSoneria to sell iPhone in the Nordic and Baltic countries.



TeliaSoneria announced Tuesday a deal with Apple to introduce iPhone to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia later this year.
This phone has still not been released in Australia, it was released in June last year and STILL we do not see it.

And as for rumors of an iPhone 2 (Hopefully with 3g and bluetooth), we probably wouldn't get it until bluetooth was replaced by infared, 3g by 3.5g and touchscreens would be out of fashion!!

Wake up Apple, just because it's "the Jesus phone" doesn't mean people will grow old waiting for it
can you put the iphone on loudspeaker
does the iphone come with 1gb memory? somebody tell me now
that's right.

Bluetooth is used only for headset and there is no way to use it for anything else.

I'm glad that you have realized how worthless this phone is! :)
the bluetooth of iphone is only for headset?

can't send or recive any file?  even on 1.1.4

if yes....i want buy it and it's baddd



:-(

Mr.Arab I Live in UAE

Ive Had iPhone FOr More Than 3 Months.

Yesterday I 4got My iPhone On Top Of My Land Cruiser And Started Drivin. It Fell Of My Car When I Was At 60 Kmph And Got Just Some Scratches. The Phone Is Working Perfectly.

And For The Freezing Thing U Might Have 2 Update The Software.
Iphone SUCKS! i gt and it brk. so i got it again and it broke. now i have it again and its frezzin. . dont bother gettin this phone. im going to get nokia n95i

now i want to talk about iphone unlocked

from all the goodies the phone have( good touch screen,etc...) there have a big problem on it



the problem is:

- the blue tooth really2 sucks, you can not transfer a data/file via blue tooth(but you still can connect a blue tooth hands free on it)

- the battery was so huge(1400mah) but the durability and the stand by time is so poor.... you need more power for this phone( approx 2/3 days for normal and 1/2 days for hardcore user)

- it is only gprs and edge. its mean is a bit slow... (remember no 3g or hdspa)

- another big problem is... other brand like nokia when you drop it.. it just fine( like my nokia n95)but this phone.....



when you drop it.... i can not say more word, you will know what i am talking about



- the last thing is... iphone is build in battery with soldering method so is not an easy like if you change your ipod battery.. its a lot harder then that



note: if you have change the battery it will make your iphone become a bit idiot and the performance is not like before you change the battery so?????

If you have your phone unlocked, or buy one unlocked, T-Mobile Pay as you go will work. When unlocked, all SIMs work. There is not need to activate it even with AT&T. Just buy it; unlock it; put in your old AT&T SIM. Or, go to a T-Mobile store and get a prepaid SIM. Or, if in another country, us the local service SIM. It's a no brainer.

Many people on this site complain about the iPhone. But the stats are in. Because of it, AT&T has toppled T-Mobile as the number-one rated carrier. Apple hasï¿½in less than a yearï¿½captured the second biggest market share. It has over 70% of the Internet usage...cause it works! v2.0 software is a huge improvement, and will cost nothing. :-)



Other phones, although somewhat better in various ways, don't have a network built for its specific useï¿½such as Microsoft Exchange Server (direct and built in the software).



Oh, and I unlocked mine. So, the age old contract issue is no factor. I will even work as a 'Pay as You Go' phone.



i was wondering that wen u buy an iPhone and register it, do u have to choose a plan or can u go pre-paid??
I have a Mac and an iPhone with v1.1.4. I went online and downloaded a software program to unlock it. In less than 10 minutes it was unlocked and working the same on T-Mobile with a data plan.



There are programs that will add the functions that everybody complains about; I have yet to try that. However, so far, 100% and unlocked.
hi, may i ask if you have problem with bluetooth? i can't transfer files using bluetooth to SE p990i. pls help. thanks
to kakh



no worry at all. nothing has happened to ur fone.

download windows version of ziphone 2.6 or 3.0 from www.ziphone.org and install it.

connect ur fone and just click "do it all". ur fone will be unlocked, activated and jailbroken in 4 mins time.





cheers
Well, I have had this phone for more than 5 months, and all I can say is... I want another phone...



Sadly everyone was right, this is a great looking phone, and funky... donï¿½t get me wrong, a lot of people will love this phone, and it will be their phone for the rest of their life, that is as long as they are forever listening to music and using the internet from everywhere they go.

I guess the target audience of this phone is more of the 14 to 21 age group. The reason I say this, is cause most adults prefer a radio... let me re-phrase, most adults have and can buy a radio, and a CD player or an MP3 player. As for watching TV, come on... in a day and age, where 21 inch monitors have become a norm, why are we looking into our hand to watch You Tube...

Sadly I did everything possible to get this phone, and loved it for the first month, and then realized how disillusioned I was... when, some one asked me, so what all can you do with the phone, and I happily listed the numerous things, and then she asked, so what do you actually do?, and I said, talking and SMS, sometimes internet, and sometimes Games...



Lets face it, this phone is not a business phone, its a very delicate mp3 player, cause you paid soo much, you donï¿½t want anything to happen to it, and you actually have to make an effort to use the other features it does have.



I have bought / used all types from Nokia to Sony Ericsson, LG, imate, HTC and even Palm and HP.... this by far, is the most astatically pleasing phone... as a friend of mine would say, itï¿½s a fashion statement, which is becoming a norm, even before it comes out in the country...



For anyone who is contemplating buying this phone and does not even own an MP3 player, and is not keen on watching tele on their phone, basically some one who drives and owns a tele and a computerï¿½ donï¿½t waste your money, get something you will actually useï¿½



I am planning on selling my Iphone off, and buying something better, but this time I am doing proper research on slightly older models, so that I dont get dissapointed...

oh come on DUDE ur sayin that it's cam quality is better than a 5MP cam ?? u gotta be kidding i think u haven't read any of the reviews, and it does NOT has GPS, they are using the google maps(mobile) technology which send signals over GSM networks to tell one's approximate location, it is NOT as accurate as GPS.

AND how many people would really install these cracked/hacked repo's ?? why is the iphone so under rated ?? coz it can't do much of the stuff, the only good thing it has is a nice UI with touchscreen. I have an n82 which can do everything the iphone can and MORE for same price.
What would anyone purchase an iPhone?

1. The OS is so outdated.

2. Most complex OS I've ever seen. Takes a degree from MIT to make a call.

3. Camera is only 8bit.

4. Music is only mono.

5. The box it comes in is too small.

6. Head phones are white and the phone is black and silver; who designed this?

7. Videos only in black & White.



Like I asked: Who in the world would ever buy this?



Well, I did! Love it. Sleep with it. :-)))
The latest addition of the iPhone 2.0 software is actually from Palm. I've unlocked mine and downloaded it directly from the Palm site. Much better. ;-)



I'm sorry, why are people so stupid they cannot find apple.com and see what 2.0 will offer? Or, is that a stupid question?

there is no option then to keep old songs in your music library on the computer.dont delete the old songs from desktop once songs are download onto ur phone or pod
zomg! this phone is awesome...for dwarfs! its so small like me..i love me
you got to add your old and new music to the same music playlist
hi vki



if ur itunes do not possess those information of ur fone in another pc, u will lose all data if u sync with a new pc.



try this,



make folders of all ur data like song, foto, vdo and contacts and then copy all in the new pc and then sync. hopefully this will work.



u can use touchcopt v3 for copying all data of ur ifone into another pc and sync.

My posts are based upon all the lazy people who are unable to go to apple.com and see the specs for 2.0; there is a video of it being used! Also, some people are so lazy, they ask a question that is directly above the opinion section.



Example: What size it the camera?



People, read a review. 99% of it is there.



Also, this site is for people all over the world; it's quite rude to use abbreviations which many people will not understand. Try typing with complete words!

How can people say this is the greatest phone ever when it has no proper bluetooth,no 3G, no picture messaging.

yaar can i set any song as ringtone in iphone....?

plzzzz help me.....
specially after purchasing an iphone-1 at premium price...



and seeing the preview at gsmarena saying that it would cost...below $200







ouch...
must have been quite painful...for someone who have just recently purchased the iphone-1 and  see a banner at the home page of gsmarena saying



"iphone is dead long live the iphone 3G!"





>_
Would`nt say the new iphone 3g is lousy but with the new 2.0 firmware coming out soon for the original phone I personally don`t think its a great upgrade, thats unless you cant live without 3G. There won`t be a great difference between the 2 phones.
Ok. Having done research on the Iphone2. It is a pathetic upgrade. Save your money people.



Cons:

1. Easily more scratched on the PLASTICback

2. Same lousy camera

It started off as 2 Megapixels. It still IS 2 Megapixels. It STILL DOES NOT RECORD VIDEO!! WTF!??!

3. No copy/paste functionality (ie no drag-dropping your files)

4. No 802.11n support

5. Same lame bluetooth support (no dual audio headsets)

6. No 32 gig version, but that will be available in a few months after being on sale

7. NO MMC/MicroSD Expansion Slot

8. STILL NO MMS SUpport





Pros:

1. 3g (no front camera)

2. Assisted GPS

3. Much cheaper WITH CONTRACT
3g iphone is coming out july 11th in the first 22 countries. Go to the apple.com store and it shows the new iphone.
11:45 am Now on to the final challenge -- affordability. Started at $599 for an 8GB iPhone, now $399. The iPhone 3G 8GB will sell for... $199.

Hi Kan,

I don't know if it is an official launch for the iphone 2.0. But it IS the start of the Apple World Wide Developer's Forum. It's basically where they annouce new stuff. Below is a link to live updates on what they're talking about. They're already half an hour in.





http://www.macrumorslive.com/


As for the iphone 2.0 launch. I'm not sure when it is coming out. I have not done my background research so I am unable to tell you. There have been rumours that it will be made available by the end of june. Here is a link to the bunch of rumours on the same website:





http://www.macrumors.com/2008/...mor-roundup/

Bluetooth could be used to link to a keyboard, transfer files between other phones or your Mac's HD, or a plethora of other basic wireless info exchanges.

very interesting chart you have there. I'm from australia and if i had an iphone, i wouldn't be surfing the net because the datacharges are insane over here. So how often do YOU surf the internet where you're from?



Oh and i'm assuming you're still grinning as you read this because the newer and possibly better iphone is going to be announced in about 30 minutes :)



should've saved your money huh?

i recomend you guys not to buy the phone.for one its doesnt hava capabiltiy to shoot video and it has the same uses and functions just like other mobile phones.go waste your money on something else
In reply to Vki, you can also try software called handbrake. There's mac and windows versions. You also don't have to download the movie to the hard drive first. Convert straight from DVD but on your preset settings you must use iPhone/iPod touch.

hi I m from India & its gr8. It has some disadvantages but overall its ok

camera is good even 2 mg pic quality is very good like 5 mg bcoz camera lensses is good.

Fast internet with edg. On airtel

mail operion is good. Onetime I use 4 mail diffrerent account.

Installer is good. New game is gr8

Sound in earplugs is very loud. But in speker its too slow

now wish is that it can upgraded in to 3g phone

ya our old one can do it?is this thing a pda and an ipod ?
Volume is very very low... Touch screen is very delicate.. I dropped the phone once and bottom part of the screen is not working at all.
Please anyone reply of:

What is the processor(mhz)?

What is the SDRAM?

Which OS is the best like WM or BB or Symbian or Apple OS?
Apple iphone is a worlds most high rate phone.But it didnt give the reward of our money.Because its facilities not much nokia nseries.Then why should apple companies giving this much price.Then i didnt like this phone.(iphone please goback on india)its the request of all indians.


> In reply to Anonymous @  from HHHH - click to read
I don't see why I should have to download all that stuff. Surely it should be on the phone already? Especially considering the amount you pay for it.



With regards to the email comment... I still think that's a poor replacement for MMS. I don't see why the phone doesn't have that feature.



And I still think touch screen is a bad idea, everyone I've known to have an iPhone has complained that the screen is constantly smudged. Oh! But it's ok! Apple have conveniently supplied me with a cleaning wipe. Rather than avoid making the phone a finger pring magnet in the first place.



Here's the main disadvantages that I copied and pasted (something else you can't do on an iPhone) from this sites official review:



* Camera has no auto focus or settings

* No video recording

* No custom ringtones allowed

* Safari browser doesn't support Flash and Java

* Really basic Bluetooth capabilities

* No Office documents editor

* No third party applications

* No 3G support (at least the US version)



This review, combined with the opinions of people I know who've owned one. I think I'll pass on this phone.
hi i think that i am going to get the apple iphone but i just want to know if it has  fm radio? PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP

I honestly don't know how Apple got away with this piece of rubbish. For starters it's massive and ugly, the screen becomes a smudgy mess after 5 seconds of use. You can't do picture messages, you can't set your own ringtone, no video recording, must only have apple software on it, no voice dialling, no voice recording. Seriously, I had better phones this 5 years ago. Why do people still buy it?? Talk about "the public wants what the public gets". This phone is an amzing example of hype and advertising.





Form the comment above you must have no idea cos you dont own it. All the Applications can be downloaded. Video Recorder, Custom Ringtown Maker and the use of Custom Software. The only thing the fone cant do is send MMS, which is replaced by something called E-mail (if you dont know what that is ELECTRONIC MAIL). And for the smudging wash your dirty hands hahaha. Apple supplies a cleaning cloth for the screen. Over all the fone is good value for money, a a nice big screen to watch your vidoes on.
can any one tell me about how to transfer saved files application etc etc to avoid message which comes on the screen now and then that your memory is full delete some data on my iphone version 1.1.4 i dont understand why such message appears on my screen as i have only use space of about 300 mb out of 8gb
Can anyone tell me how to match the dock background with the wall paper ....mine is different..

If someone said to you "wanna buy a phone? its got the internet on it, and you can make calls and send texts but that's about it. Also it's touch screen. Oh and its big enough to have a gravitational pull, but it's got a camera!" What would you say? Obviously no. Stop buying this phone!!

Hi all of you.. Well it seems from your comments that the phone is good and not good at the same time :S ... One of the major things that I use on my phone is the bluetooth.. does this phone have bluetooth inwhich you want to share files with other devices? Secondly, I want to know if this phone has a loud voice? I mean can I hear it while I am in work or in the mall? Thirdly, does this phone take vedios with the camera that it has? Is the screen very sensetive and scrach or break easily like my Nokia E61i?



Please reply quickly because I want to buy this phone within 3 days!!

thanx!

Can anyone pleeeeease tell me how to proceed for the installation of software on my iphone.

I do not have the installer right now on the iphone.

I am using the iphone only to make/receive call and send sms.I have heard that the iphone is a treasure to explore.

So please please please tell me friends how to proceed!!!!!!!Thanks and long live all friends on this site
Funny how people hate the phone and never used it before, they are like omg its apple people love it because its sexy!

The phones volume is loud enough, the build quality is amazing, bluetooth is fine, wifi is good, the battery life is nice, the installer program makes downloading apps/games over wifi super fast and easy, phone updates are nice. what other phone has this kind of stuff? exactly.
I  bought my iPhone from AT&T around 6 months back. i live in london, so i brought it over here, and suprisingly it worked. i think it is because i have bought the phone, not on the contract. anyways what my problem is, my phone refuses to vibrate even though the vibration is turned on.



Please help me in this matter.

thanks

hi iwould ike to know from u that why do u say thatit is a waste of money.

just reply me pls.
when u call a person and the person is at anothe call does the phone indicate that?The samsung i900 0mnia is much better than the iphone. The iphone promisses you everything, but he doesnt make your expertaitions come through. The samsung is more expensive, but you get more stuff and he has a camera with 5mp. Wow.

Hi Thabith,

Great Effort....

I wanted to buy an iPhone. But after reading your opinion i made up my mind not to buy.



- A phone without Bluetooth(for File    Transfer),

- 2 MP camera without flash, Autofocus, No video recording

- Higher End Phone without java

- No FM radio (one of the main features now a days)

- Can't change battery, can't remove SIM

- Need to keep on paying for every thing  -     - iTumes

- Internet

- Geames

- Movies

- Etc.



Absolutely unfit for Indians

its not that lousy you know

it is true it can't zoom and flash

but the picture is fairly nice and clear..

you can zoom using 3rd party software tough..



i nvr use flash on my all phones so i don really care..

i use flash for flash light maybe :D LOL



no bluetooth i don really mind either since i'm not using it alot..

altough it is a bit tiring to transfer the data via my mac book if i want to put it to my phone but i think its fairly ok..



besides ppl must agree it have much better OS than crappy windows mobile...
I want to buy an iphone could some some one tell me is this phone is good? what about the blutooth is it realy bad?I coolect the money for many years please answer me I dont want to wast the moeny? if its not good tell me which phone is the best?
Iphone lovers, I wonder what you think about the fact this phone only has a lousy 2mp camera without zoom, focus, flash etc. Also you can't record videos. And what about not being able to bluetooth a picture/video/song? Really strange to buy a phone like this one for the price it costs.
The picture on Apple iPhone 3G gallery is not corect it looks like the first Iphone.
dont buy this phone its cheap but really very bad u will hav to regret

People planning to buy a iPhone ... Please go through this first





!!! BEWARE OF BUYING iPhone 3G!!!



Friends.....those of you in India planning for iPhone... THINK TWICE BEFORE MAKING A DECISION... The short comings of iPhone are endless...





No video calling,



no AD2P on the Bluetooth,



CAN'T share ANY (mp3, images,videos....) files via bluetooth,



can't use as a wireless modem, (you pay ridiculous data charges to activate internet on your phone, but cannot connect it to your PC and browse when you are at home)



no copy and paste,(cannot copy a part of a.... say.... email & send it....have to type it out yourself)



no 3.2 or 5 megapixel camera,(the 2MP camera it carries is worst camera i've ever seen..... photos look like they have come out of a VGA camera)



no video recording with camera,



no front camera,



no flash.



no JAVA support



No physical keyboard (BELIEVE me! this alone is a dealbreaker...touch keyboard as good as it looks...once you use it then only you come to know about the importance of having a hard keypad)



No 3G network yet in India..so why pay for expensive 3G phone if you cant use its 3G services ... so, for India, iPhone 2.0 is no better than its first version



No removable battery. (You cannot change battery. Have to send it to apple outlet.. Come on now!!!!...This is not an iPod. Its a bloody phone. You cannot live without phone for 2-3 days)



No haptic feedback and



cannot send MMS,



can't use as external storage device (16 GB of utter waste..next time you go to your friend's house & find some interesting songs, movies, etc...sorry you cannot connect your '16 GB' phone and share it!!!! Apple apparently has a solution.. " BUY MUSIC & MOVIES FROM iTUNES STORE "..... Give me a break will you APPLE!!!)



no FM radio,



can't use your mp3 files as ringtones,(This is heights man!!!)



cannot insert any other SIM cardï¿½.



completely tied to iTunes... Connect to your friend's iTunes & you risk erasing everything on your phone.



list goes on & on & onï¿½.







We Indians are used to these features. Most of our phones already have these features. & we cannot do with out them.... i mean can you imagine paying so much for a phone with which you cannot transfer files via bluetooth. what age is this ...STONE AGE???



Some features may be activated by jailbreak.. But why the hell should you risk losing your warranty after paying so much.



And want to add third party softwares??.. YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM FROM iTUNES STORE ONLY!!! . (Shell out more money). Apple is a bloody control freak. Dont surrender your freedom to it.



Its good for american market (who have no idea what mobile freedom/choice is) which is in stone age compared to asian/european markets. When they want to buy a phone, they have to go to network operators and buy only those phones that are available on that network. & stick to that company till their contract expires. You want to change carriers? Not before paying damages, & buying another phone on the other network again.



On the contrary, we in India have so much freedom. We go to handset shops & buy which ever phone we like. Then go to carriers.. checkout the plans & buy SIM. Dont like the plan or rival carrier came up with a better plan???? EASY . just remove & replace the SIM.



Apple are trying to IMPOSE THEIR MODEL ON US riding on the hype iPhone has created in the US (yes it was a flop in Europe .thats why Apple never talks about its sales in Europe).



Dont fall for the subsidized price of iPhone... CHECKOUT THE DATA PLAN ATTACHED TO ITS SIM ..they will recover the cost through ridiculous data plans. Bill might come to around Rs 2500/month.(ATLEAST AMERICANS PAY THAT MUCH)



Let me clear one thing though.. iphone is the best looking phone (its touch interface is nothing like you have ever seen ), & best browsing experience out there no doubt .... (& others are fast catching up..check out the android demo at Google IO 2008).... BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO FUNCTIONALITY...



Those of who buy it... You will be most happy for atmost a week... & then, MARK MY WORDS...YOU WILL START REGRETTING IT!!!





My advice...WAIT FOR HTC DREAM!! (powered by android). Still not convinced by then...by all means go for iPhone...



So friends lets spread this info to all our friends and help them in making a wise decision.... & those of you who have bought unlocked versions already please share your experiences with others



THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.... GOODLUCK!!!
this i phone is great does it havr blue thooth

In indonesia/sumatera where we get infr abt

iphone. last sunday my frd sw t me abt iphone

bt i du now anymore. pl
its weird to see lots of ppl hate this phone,,

I dunno are they apple haters or what,,

but I phone is really a new revolution on the phone trends and also you guys have to admit it has the best touch screen response from other touch screen phones..

it also has gorgeous looks and it is a good phone for you that love phones with gorgeous looks and interface..



for me personally phone is just to make phone calls, texting, and listen to the music,, so i dun mind with some of iPhone disadvantages..



if you guys wanna buy phone that have 5 or 8 mp camera why bother buyin n95 or the new samsung? go buy digital camera with cheaper price and better quality,, it can record video also btw..



if you want a brand new phone with cool looks and new user interface that can give new experience then buy iPhone..



its better to have phone with good multimedia than buying phone with good camera, especially apple is a pro in making ipods so no worries with this one,, LOL



I've bought it and i think i'm pretty satisfied although to be honest i expect more from apple xp
Hi all,



Really need help. I've updated the iphone software to 2.0 i think, via the itunes. Subsequent to that, the software have been restore and now my SIM is not compatible with the phone. For your information, I'm a user in Malaysia.



Can i change back to the previous software package? or is there any other solutions.



Thanks.

IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY!! A problematic phone... i bought it really expensive and after 2 months i had problems with the text keyboard, it got really slow, when i was in the internet it took me to the menu, it wouldn't send or accept pictures, videos or music with bluetooth like other phones, i couldn't download anything from my pc and in the end something happend and i couldn't charge it so i was left with no phone... oh! and it fell down one time and it is like i had it for 10 years. nobody told me this things. they just want to sell "phones".

This Samsung e500 is the best looking phone i ever bought, it has all the features that I need to survive, features like Mp3 player, Loud Speaker, Color Screen and much more.



So go to your nearest Reject Shop and buy yourself one or two for Christmas, You'll be all set for the future.







Can anyone tell me if i use Wi-Fi to serve the net most of the time but i still received charges from the local provider for download of data? And do I need to set up the phone before it is GPRS enabled.

My iphone is 8GB.
its more of an itouch with a bit of phone, rather than a phone with ipod.  It just makes you look good, more of a fashion statement, more than anything else. and that's just it.  only those feature geek will definitely turned off with this phone.

what nonsense ? When phone hangs iphone user does not have to wait for battery to drain. In fact if u do so then the lights of the phone might get weeker. The solution is to do a soft reset i.e. hold the top button & the home button together unless the screen goes blank. Leave both the buttons immediately when u see the screen go blank as if u keep the home button pressed the phone will take u in recovery mode. Once u see the blank screen leave both the buttons & then press the top button to start the iphone again. Hope this helps.

i dont agree with your opinion.

iPhone is great phone because of SDK, third party programs also with programs are very easy to control and no hassle like N95 or HTC. ( WM base programs are slow and not very good quality as Apps and same to Symbiam Applications)



OK if you compare only with Smart Phone spects. of course iPhone is shit compare with HTC Diamond or N95 8GB, However HTC diamond got small screen and do not carry better touch screen effect than iPhone. ! its same to N95 8GB !



i have been using iphone 2.5G from when it first released and changed to N95 8GB than Diamond and now i back to iPhone because i could not find applications which is easy to use and gives good effect to me.



in my opinion, Symbiam OS applications are still below Apple's App and its same to WM 6.1 Applications as well.

I don't know why there are persons who think iPhone is much better than Nokia or HTC or Sony Ericsson. Maybe that persons know nothing about technology or cellular phones.Or They have never had a N95,N95 8GB or a N82.I think iPhone is a beautiful handset, but without the wonderful features Nokia phones have offered for years.Some friends have used Nokia phones but then, they decided to get the iPhone...in a few weeks they realized that It had been a big mistake. They have returned to Nokia and forgatten about the iPhone. I think everyone should buy the phone they want. But one think is for sure: Nokia is the best brand, and maybe the second one is HTC

true

its true iphone is nothing new except for its fancy full touch screen UI,,

then why all phone  try to follow apple's path and tries to optimize their phone UI and touch screen ability??

(this include the "great" nokia of course"...



anyway what i like from iPhone??

the looks, UI of course, ipod, and battery life.
Hey guys i think its a waste of ur money.da bluetooth does't work and most of all no vdeo recording.its just stylish nokia is far more better than this.a little bit longer , rs . a good celular, but . . .
Is it true that u cannot change the battery of the Iphone 16G.

you have to jail break your phone in order to get the ringtone maker
I like my iphone, but where can i find applications for the iphone. like games and funny stuf?
I bought this phone and I love the applications, and the navigation. However I don't like that you have to buy your ringtones from itunes!!!! And you can't use the songs from your ipod as a ringtone.

Where to start with the iPhone??



I started off with a 2G that originally wasn't available in my country (Australia)

I played with it, loved it, and pretty much showed it off to everyone I knew.



Then I upgraded. To the 3G. The iPhone went from 10 out of 10 on my list to 100 out of 10. I think it's seriously that good.



Nuff said.

there is no message forarding option

no hscsd and?

no bt yes it does but not for file shearing

2 mpx camera- high res

no infra - stone age

no stylus - why? stone age

no 3g - it is 3g?

no flash - you have a point

no video recording - you can if you jailbreak it.

no radio - you can via loads of apps for free

no voice guidence - coming soon (tomtom)

no card slot - only your 2nd point but memory 8 or 16 gig is enough for a phone



To be honest it is a great phone and if you manage to hack it via cybia loads of extras

look ipohone uses ipod to run audio and video files...as u know we cant transfer files from an ipod thru bluetooth...and also it uses mp4 format for videos..iphone is GADGET OF THE YEAR 2008..so u best buy apple iphone than n96 or any other smartphones
i'd like to defend i-phone, we should understand the essential of usage of i-phone, there are more things than blue-tooth or other applications of others phones from nokia, samsung ou sony-ericsson.

I agree with some words said but we should relax and try to learn with this new concept of celphone. this is another world

Well , I bought used one online for $100.00 it was 4gb, it lasted me about 3 months. I dropped the phone at the mall parking and the screen cracked. After that I sold it for 135.00. The guy who bought it said he was going to try to fill the glass. Be very careful with this phone , one drop and you are done

The fact that one has to continuously add these programs is usless when u can get an inexpensive yet more superb phone like the LG vu that comes with all of these features. Your inexcusable remarks to defend the iphone are contradictory to what others are mentioning!!!
i would like to ask if iphone fits wtih other bluetooth unit and someone ask me that it doesnt have an forward message
does the iphone 1st gen has very poor speakers?? pls help..
VErry limited possiblities, always at apple's mercy with issues like warranty and software .... and verry expensive for what it is. But it's beautifull .. so it has fewer options than it's competitor's but in a more beautifull package.... still for the money I would buy a nokia nseries ...

Again, you posted a comment without re-thinking about what you said.

Perhaps this phone isn't for the regular technophobes or techno-slow.



BOTTOMLINE: Figure out how to use this phone.

This is certainly NOT for the ignorant.

yes. there's media player application that can be installed that recognizes .AVI files.

But if you don't want to install it, I suggest you convert those .AVI files to .MP4 for it to be played in your iphone's "IPOD"
main disadvantages:

camera has no auto focus or settings ---there's an application for the improvisation of the iphone camera

e.g. snapture



no video recording --- again, you can install an application for e.g. cycorder



no custom ringtones allowed --- yes. this can be done.



safari browser doesn't support flash and java --but it's the most efficient and effective browser , ever



really basic bluetooth capabilities --- this one's for the accessories (earphones etc.)



no office documents editor --- again. this can be installed.



no third party applications --- duhh. "installer' & "cydia"  can be used for customizations



no 3g support (at least the us version) --who effin needs 3g?

-------------------------------------



and FYI wireless transfer is possible.

some people are just too slow.

there are gazillions of applications to choose from.

now, before you say that the iphone sucks. better make sure that you know A LOT about it snd you know how to use it.

the best phone i've ever had.

those who whine do not know how to use it properly.

just figure out how to customize and install applications on it...and you will find out how awesome it is.



other phone's uhhh pale in comparison
if sumone can pls tell me...

supoz a contact is added as +92333... insted of 0333... the caler name duznt apear, and viceversa ,,,can anyone pls help memy mummy got me this phone for christmas and i think its terrible because it has a 2 mega pixel camera and is really pathetic! wats ur opinion on this????

No....you can update the firmware from itunes and it will remain unlocked but you wil lose your jaikbreak if you have it on there.  It will only lock if you do a restore.

Hmmmm. Mine has bluetooth. My calculator is perfect. Installed a video cam, and a voice recorder from software picked of 1000's. Phone quality is great. Movies and YouTube and quicktime are great. Voice command software is great. 10 games out of the thousands available are amazing. Web surfing (magnifying etc.is untouched by any other phone. I even got utility software out of 1000's available that uses my webcam from the house to watch the babysitter from my iphone 100's of miles away. Are you sure you are not using one of the cheap clones out there. Even your computer crashes all the time according to you. Maybe you are just unlucky or not unreal.   Rob
Just got my iphone using edge network (no 3g but fairly fast) Cannot believe how amazing it is. Just the feel and look compare to t-mobile g1 or sprint instinct. They feel "plastic-ish" and do the web pretty lousy. Not even in the same league as the iphone in my humble opinion. But the real difference is the software available for the iphone. Making it do incredible things. You can buy the best computer in the world, but if it doesn't have a lot of software for it, it just sits there. Another analogy would be a DVD player or VCR player. You can have the best player out there but without the movies for it, it is nothing. I have never been able to do so much with such a cool pocket device and it's a great phone too.

What a wast of money and a phone

NO bluetooth file transfer!

NO video!

2mp camera!



people dont believe the hype about this phone! its s**t!
This phone can do wonders, just the camera needs a lil work but its the best buy in the market... with a 3g 6GB plan!
There are a lot of foolish people out there. Do some research before buy anything that is expensive. Say, i would not buy a car before found out it is a 10 cyclinder car.
i have this fone im from banglapore india i have this phonee and i have is this unlocked? i can play music it very good ya? me like is fun play video ringtone firstclass.
No file transfer over bluetooth? I'm a man of 2008, wifi is everything, bluetooth for anything other than voice comms is basically saying 'im built to communicate with old, out of date phones'.



No MMS? Are you a caveman? Who uses MMS beyond young kids and old people? Why not just **EMAIL** the picture?

Hi,

Thank u so much for ur response but m not sure how to install all those softwares :-( can i get some website details & also some screen shots...



Regards,

Varun
Word came out that the 2.3 firmware update will be available some time in April.  Earlier leaks stated that copy/paste is going to be included in the update, but recent, more reliable posts no longer mention copy/paste being on the list, but it did not say that it won't be included either, there was just no mention of it.  I really hope that copy/paste would be included because I am really getting tired of having to retype every time I need to capture a phrase or something from notes, or from a website, or from an SMS.  If copy/paste is not included in the 2.3 update, I'll get my iphone unlocked and sell it, and then I'm switching to Palm Pre or the N97.  I can live with its 2mp camera, or no MMS, or no SMS forwarding, or no BT because I really don't care for those features, but I really think that copy/paste is essential on a smart phone.

hi srikanth



namaste



ur friend is right. if u upgrade to any version of fw, ur fone will get locked. if u remain up to 1.1.4 version, it is easy to unlock and jailbreak again.

upgrade from itune to 1.1.4 , remember it is 162 mb of download, and activate using ziphone 2.6 or 3.0.



things are very simple.

if u wanna to upgrade to 2.1, it is also comparatively easy, upgrade (232 mb) and use winpawn 2.5. and then enjoy.



if u r using 3g, then first jailbreak and unlock using "yellowsn0w". u get this software in cydia.

browse through the internet u will get all the answers.

this phone have a problm bluetooth ! cant send and cant pair other device?
its touchcreen is revolutionary as what phone will generate 16 MILLION colours and still have a fully functional touchscreen?



and remember, this was in 2007.
htc diamond is iphone killer

Once I placed my prejudices aside and actually got the phone I was shocked. The phone is remarkable, rivaled by none. The things you can do with this device, the manner in which it handles tasks truly make me believe the iPhone is the greatest phone ever created, to date.
I've also heared that

the Arabic translation of the I phone is haked

Is that true?



I'm planning to buy it but

after all of what I've heared

I have to reconceder that



& the things are

1* as I've said before..it's haked

2* the bluetooth doesn't send or resive pictures & musics.

3* I can only use I-Tune tunes.

4* It doesn't contain a radio

5* I can't send or resive mms's.

THE BEST PHONE EVER. Had it for almost 2 years, and can't think of a better phone. It's the pioneer of touch screen phones, and also the best of'em. No other touch screen phones (and supposedly "good" os'ed phones) are even nearly as good as iPhone. There's no worthy competitor of iPhone, at least not yet. Love the App Store. It really makes u aware of how powerful a smartphone can be.

(i guess pandora is similar? well, its free anyway)
the iphone is a good phone 4 the internet it works good enoughThis Is My 23rd phone to date and by far the worst mobile phone i have ever encountered. The programming is terible and basic functions non exsistent, ie bluetooth transfer and sms msg forwarding.. Battery life is very poor and the phone is constantly freezing and to top that Apple aftersales is terrible and im tied to and 18 month contract and the phones lyin at the bottom of a drawer :( :( :(

Now Using A nokia N95 8Gb - Which just completely blows the iphone out of the water in everyway with the exception of web browsing.. Very Dissapointed Withe THE APPLE iPhone....
i have iphone 1.1.4....but i m not able to install applications from itunes,when i m connect my phone with itunes,there is no option for application.......but connect my itouch there is option.......so plzzz help me.....to install
Very Cool phone! for all problems pertaining to firmware, you can search it by google, try to look for the website ICLARIFED or HACKINTOSH for iphone troubleshooting. Low sound problems sometimes pertains to registry configuration and its fixable, iphone hangs & home buttons freezes some times its due to multi tasking or certain applications are still running on the background and its causing your iphone to process a bit harder. remember iphone 2G only has a processor speed of 400Mhz or Plus. probably try downloading SBsettings on the tweak section in cydia for you to have an option to manually kill any process running on the background. Loving the Iphone more & more each day!

you have to register 1st at apple store through itunes. install itunes, then click "store" button. then u can create your own account. and you need to have credit card for that. if u don't have then post back i will send u how to fool apple and create account without credit card. regarding upgrade, ((((be verrrrrryy carefull))) if you have unlocked iphone, after upgrade may be u get msg "sim not recognized". so first be sure that you have all the "unlocking tools" in ur pocket, means "quickpwn, proper ispw" etc...

If you want a convenient and economical replacement for your iPhone, then the NOKIA 5800 might be a good choice.

But if you are willing to pay some more money, then you should probab;y go for SAMSUNG i8910 OmniaHD. It's the best phone with the most complete and best features you can get.
it is all about the k850i wonderful phone love it!!

And yes this operating system has some more features like Push mail  etc... and it's more user friendly than the earlier version. The camera is more clear.... I mean the picture quality has improved a little. ...... It's WORTH UPDATING.......

It's okay, you won't lose anything. You need to connect your phone to your computer. Make sure you have the latest itunes software. When you see the phone in tines right click on its icon and select backup. After backup, update (not restore) the software and you should have everything as it was. if you lose everything, you can still restore from backup. You will get everything including SMS's.
3.0 beta will not work in iphone 3G, but in 2G it work

By default, apple doesn't allow you to install any third-party application on iPhone. "Jailbreak" means to break that limitation of apple. By applying the Jailbreak you can use third-party applications on your iphone...

if you just want to disable the Edge, then you can install application called "sbs settings" from cydia. (ur iphone need to be jailbroken to install cydia application)
how do u deactivate Edge?

Hi Mehboob.

i use my iphone in my car audio system and it give me excellent sound quality and base. so don't know what wrong with your one.



Regarding video recording, if your phone is jailbroken i.e if its got cydia installer in it, then open cydia. download and install "cycorder". using this application you can make unlimited movies. and this is a free application.
Dear Tanoli,

Thanks for your advice about data transfering.Could pls advice below;



a) Sound Volume: When I listen music with loud speaker which sound volume is so poor, is there any technical way to increse the volume level.

b) Capturing Video: Only possible to make video 30 second in one shot.What's the way to unlimitrd video.

The 3G S sucks to you because I'm guessing you had the 3G before it, going from 3G to 3GS isn't really smart, they're the same thing except for a few details (camera and processor). For someone not currently owning an iPhone, the 3G S is really the only one you should consider. The 1st 2 sucked, except now with the 3.0 software they're pretty much the same. So yeah the iPhone 3GS isnt worth it if you have the 3G, but if you have the first one or just about to get one, than the 3GS is the best option.

The Best Touch screen Mobile out, not much differant to the 3G & 3GS, i've unlocked & Jailbreaked mine also updated to a Modified vertion of V3.0 Firmware, DOnt update with the officail V3.0 firmware as this will remove the unlock & jailbreak mode.

This is your lucky day :

i happened to opened this post and saw your question,i have the right answer for you since i've used Omnia & iPhone (mine is iPhone3Gs now)so the answer is .. :



iPhone



I'm saying this because the UI of iPhone is unmatched by any smartphones out there,but things you should remember before buying iPhone--you probably already knew but i'd remind you again--are :



1)No bluetooth transfer for either sending or receiving songs,pics,videos,you have to do it all with iTunes.



2)No video recording.



3)2MP camera in iPhone,personally i'd prefer to choose the 2MP of iPhone compared to 5MP Omnia,too bad the only way to know why i'm saying this is because i've used Omnia & iPhone,so it's better if you could compare the camera from the device then you know why i'd prefer the little 2MP,but no matter how good iPhone's camera it's still 2MP.



4)The difference of processor between them,but it should be less concern.



Besides those things above,iPhone beats Omnia in every aspects,even Omnia II & Omnia HD are still no match to iPhone's interface.



One last thing : some of my friends have used HTC Diamond,HTC Magic,Omnia HD,N97,LG Arena,BB Storm,but once they try iPhone,none of them dare to compare their handset anymore against iPhone,in fact some of them sold their phone and changed it to iPhone.
*things on this?*
Piece of crap. Don't get fooled.



You can do many this on this? Wait 'till you lay your hands on it.



And don't go back crying here in this section.

I will get this phone next month and I am very happy =)! The good thing about iPhone that is that you can do many fun things on it. It's not a bussines phone, it's an intertaiment phone. You can do much more things on it than other phones, even if they cost more than iPhone. But if you aren't careful you shouldn't buy it because it will break very easly...

Hi,,everyone



to elucidate all the question for iphone regarding jailbreak and other peripherals, I will incite my own experience regarding to this issue,,(I have iphone 2g 8gb)



First,, jailbreak,, I thought this one is tough,, but believe me, you can do it by urself,, I upgraded to OS 3.1.2 which is the latest version of OS,,the problem is it will return to factory settings which if you want to install lots of app. You have to jailbreak first,

I use blackra1n to do this,,(best way to do it!) the install cydia from blackra1n donï¿½t install both cydia and rock it sucks! After installing cydia install bootneuter 2.0,then flash your baseband to 4.6 then woola!!!you can use other network than AT&T which I donï¿½t have,,LOL! Afterwards, if you want videocam to your iphone??YES!its possible thru Cycorder,,download it from cydia!..

Merry Christmas and happy new year for you bro.



Too bad i'm late in finding your post here,and you have your answer already,that funkyto guy already answered your question,and yes what the guy said is true,as for 3gp i haven't tried one yet,but the MP4 quality is great,i'm using any DVD converter for iPod.



I'd suggest you choose iPhone 3G,it's a lot powerful in browsing and more storage than 2g,but less in battery life for 3G?



BTW there's a camcorder app.for iPhone now available in App.store for iPhone 2G & 3G.
well own an iphone 2g..this is my 2nd one haha..well from my point of view,it has style and lots of apps..but but but..the setback is tat it is a troblesome phone..have to connect to itune,sync the phone,everytime u nid to do things with it,itune have to be use hahaha..well i'm from singapore,intend to sell my iphone for ard $400.any taker?hahaha
iPhone got 6,012,811 hits!!! why is not included in the ranking of top phone by interest?????
i am using iphone for past 2 years and find it very convenient. only backdrop is the battery standby. every day the phone needs to be charged. if you use it for music then it will have to charged every hour or so... very bad battery stand up.. some improvement is necessary.



the feature like video capture is not available immediate apple should make it availabe. some time it is quiet a requirement.

VIRUS OF MAC!!!



OSX/Leap-A is programmed to use the iChat instant messaging system to spread itself to other users. As such, it is comparable to an email or instant messaging worm on the Windows platform. Worms are a sub category of the group of malware known as viruses.



Therefore, it is correct to call OSX/Leap-A a virus or a worm

Seriously, the iPhone in general is probably at least a few generations ahead of anything that came out at its time.  I dont know how the iPhone 3GS compares to Android, I have almost no hands on experience with Android but what I saw, I hated on Android.



I would ABSOLUTELY get an iPhone over a Nokia.



Hope you go for the iPhone.

LMAO....$300.00 for an iPhone 2G??



Have you been smoking meth dude?  The 2G is basically worthless, as it's missing even the most basic of features, but if anyone were to buy one, you shouldn't pay anything over $175.00, even if it's brand new.

I am still using mine.

No antenna problems, no drop calls, no freezing, no daily charging needed!



Comparing to the new versions, yes not much functionality etc. But what more do you need than to text and call?



This is probably the best one they have done!

How can I get it???
iPhoneOS/SDK limitations:

iDon't have native multitasking(1), apps have to be specially coded for multitasking (1993)(2)

iDon't allow cross compiling.

iDon't allow open development.

iDon't have proper platform security.

iDon't have proper application security(1), any non iStore app can damage your phone(2)

iDon't have any power optimization - the device overheats as admitted by Apple.



Camera:

iDon't have fine detail in pictures, high noise reduction smears the finer details.

iDon't have video stabilization.

iDon't have exposure control (ISO).



Misc:

iDon't handle handwriting.

iDon't have built-in basic functionality like:

sending contact cards via BT, TO-DO application, save web pages, calendar week view, etc.

iDon't have freeware, iTunes treats free applications like purchases + FairPlay DRM wrap.

iDon't have user privacy for: online shopping(1), visited sites(2), your location(3)
File management:

iDon't have access to my internal folders by any means - no app in the iStore allows this!

iDon't even have access to set mp3s as ringtones.

iDon't have MIDP/JAVA support.

iDon't handle DivX, XviD, FLV native video.

iDon't handle ZIP, RAR or SFX - no app in the iStore allows this!



Connectivity:

iDon't handle videocall via the network, gTalk or Skype.

iDon't A2DP right (BT stereo) right: lags on videos(1)  and games(2).

iDon't fully support AVRCP (BT remote)(1) industry standard(2) can't skip tracks.



iDon't support any Bluetooth services when pairing with a MacBook.

iDon't have any BT file sharing my BT is almost useless!



User Interface:

iDon't have themes support.

iDon't have a scalable OS, apps on the iPad are simply stretched to fit.

iDon't have a desktop, entire UI is organized as a single "start" menu.

iDon't have parallax (finger/screen offset) adjusting - low precision especially on small objects.
Media/camera:

iDon't have stereo speakers.

iDon't have radio.

iDon't have FM transmitter.

iDon't have decent camera (small sensor and 72 DPI, which is less than most 5mp phones)



Design:

iDon't eject my sim without a special key.

iDon't have a removable battery.

iDon't have hot swappable memory.

iDon't sell cheap but my value at FOXCONN in China(1), where I am made, is ~190$(2)







SOFTWARE:

iOS 4.0



Web:

iDon't have audio/video streaming for 90% of the multimedia sites.

iDon't offer a real web experience, various sites only offer a phone version.

iDon't have Flash or Flash Lite - flash sites, apps or games simply do not work.

iDon't have push idle so battery drains fast even on push.

iDon't have push e-mail if i'm jailbroken, even if you pay!

iDon't render HTML5 graphics, nor can iHandle HTML5 controls.

iDon't process HTML attachments correctly.
Great features still missing in iPhone 4



HARDWARE:

iPhone 4



Hardware flaws (exclusively in iPhone 4):

External uninsulated antennae that cause dropped calls and slow internet connections.

Screen and back made out of cheap glassy material that both scratches and cracks.

Inverted volume controls on some units.

SIM cards don't work in some units.

Camera doesn't work in some units.

Proximity sensor doesn't work in some units.

Microphone doesn't work in some units



Screen:

iDon't have a touch friendly screen, gloves, pens, styluses and not even fingernails work!

iDon't have neither haptic nor any other type feedback whatsoever.

iDon't have any precision compared to resistive touchscreens.

iDon't have a standard(16:10, 16:9, 4:3) aspect ratio only Apple custom ones(3:2) will fit my screen.



Power:

iDon't have USB charging without a dock adapter.

iDon't have any safety garment for the battery(1)  melting is known to occur in Apple products(2)

iDon't have warranty for damage made by "external" force aka. the above.



Connectivity:

iDon't have DLNA (streaming HD content wireless on a HDTV).

iDon't have UPnP technology (automatic WiFi setup) some networks simply don't work.

iDon't have full 3G HSDPA speed (7mb/s vs. 2008 smatphones that have 10mb/s).

iDon't have full GPRS/EDGE speed (CLASS 10 is four times slower than CLASS 33!)

iDon't have a decent GSM/GPS/WiFi signal(1) the connection is far worse than on 3GS(2)

iDon't have standard USB connectivity(1) only custom cables(2)

iDon't give a damn about the environment: short cables but tons of iAccesories.

iDon't have IR, can't control: basic household items(1) TV, HDTV(2) DSLR camera(3) MAC(4)

Dude, your phone is locked ! you need to unlock it to see the main menu.this phone is simply rubish, the technology has moved, there are at least 10 different brand out there which by far better than this con, avoid at any cost you would regret

not mentioning the antena problem which everyone in UK seems to experience it and not many admit it

its simply a JOKE

Download 3.1.3 firmware file first

download iphone3.1.3/7E18 file



switch off your phone, (phone is off) hold your home button for 10 seconds then holding it plug your phone to iTunes it will show your phone in restore mode showing itunes logo & cable connecting it (on phone)





remember it will format your phone all data will be deleted

it will restore your phone to latest firmware and then unlock using redsnow :)

Stranger my man I in South Africa. So what is my APN address? Geeez I am struggling hereHope this phone is okay i am putting my money on it now,just let me know if it okay
it is good.
This is my current phone and i can say that it is GREAT (i know that it's 4 years old and all) but i think that the user-friendly interface will please all !!!!!!
I am using iPhone 4 and waiting get the Verizon iPhone next month.But few articles I read about it made me reluctant.
One of the Best handset from Apple that we can offer at this time is Iphone 2g and 3g, rest 3gs and Iphone 4 are over our budget..

I would say, best to go with 3g rather 2g, cos of the IOS4 support..

2g wont support IOS4 and the last firmware was 3.1.3..

And unlocking is like an Piece of cake while it comes to an Iphone 2g rather 3g..

For bluetooth file transfer or AD2p profile, we can use Cydia to download appropriate plugins for it..

Iphone does support file transfer and AD2p only with Apple products, we can bypass this thing using some plugin..

There are many Youtube videos regarding it..



There are some IOS4 modded frimware which are build for Iphone 2g...



Iphone 2g still supports all latest apps and games..



for any other doubt regarding the Iphone 2g kindly mail me at bondarun1@gmail.com



I want this one. But I'm damn confused about its specifications. I wanna think more before buying it.
LoL, This phone has shit.... It doesn't have GPS, 3G, complete bluetooth capability [only bluetooth headset works, no A2DP or file transfer], it got cut-copy-past just about a year ago...



Above all no equalizer inside the music player, you need to go all the way to settings to change the equalizer to rock,pop or jazz.... And they call it user friendly!

Actually no it doesn't.  It uses cell triangulation which varies greatly on it's accuracy of being able to pinpoint your location.  Not nearly as accurate as GPS.

You could download an app for that.
my question:

do iphone have Televion or...
Great phone and really good quality build. But I would say don't get iPhone 2g as it is no longer supported by Apple. YOu wont be able to install latest firmwares and most of the app does no longer work on older firmware. (ex. Viber)
Well i dont think the information from this site is precise..........

Most of them are incorrect........
top hand set mine lasted for 3 full years before battery gave up. www.swervball.com now have 4 even better than before.
iphone is only available used. get it form ebay or craigs list. only 2g. the ihpone 4 is only 3g not 4g. they are all horrible phones. keep your hand off the bottom right corner or all reception is lost. if u really wants a good cheap realible smart phone that can do all the iphone can. go with a droid phone.

Yes. Do not try to go above 3.1.3. It is the highest and most suitable for Iphone 2g.

If you are using a windows computer, then put the Iphone in restore mode and download Itunes. When you open Itunes with your iphone connected to your computer via USB in still in restore mode then Itunes will find it and ask to restore it with the latsest firmware. If you are using a mac, simply connect the Iphone as it is, the mac will then ask if you want to update the Iphone.

You can buy it from ebay. Why don't you just buy the Iphone 4? It has a much higher firmware which support thousands of more new apps. Many apps these days won't support this Iphone 2g's firmware.
U can buy this phone from the antique shop. verrrry pricey.!

It is Kinda Heavy for me and it is not convenient .. I may say it is quite expensive for me as a student but for me if you want a best and nothing but the best choose apple or samsung
its good but not the best of apple
apple is unaffordable

It should be cheap to gain popularity

One advantage of Iphone over other OS is the ability to make free calls. Not using billable minutes an awesome advantage:

apple iphone is much better than nokia n95 8gb. Iphone supports android platform which is latest and better than N95's symbian platform. Also you can download android application for your iphone from android market.

what is the best phone?nokia n958gb or iphone?i planning to buy a new phone.help me
Great phone. I think this phone had the best design of all the other models with close tie with iPhone4. The round edges, aluminium back and comfortable to hold in hand.

I think the new iPad2 design has taken som inspiration from the good old 2Gs design.

Anyways, This phone is pretty obsolete now, as it ain't being supported anymore. Some apps won't work on it and so on. Would only buy for collecting purposes. You are lucky if you find a sealed 2G today. Saw one on Ebay for 1000 dollars.

Buy a new battery on eBay for 5 bucks with free shipping.  Look up replacement tutorial on YouTube and follow along.  I buy, refurbish, and resell iPhones as my job and it's not that difficult if you know what your doing.  I can repace a battery in about 8 min from start to finish on iPhone 2g 3G or 3gs but it will probably take you around an hour.

iphone 1st gen is a brick. Yes, it's touch graphical user interface is the best among mobile phones even today. Price overrated, like all apple products. They made a very basic phone with a very few functions... downloadable apps, downloadable apps, who cares... apple could put for example A built am/fm receiver, but no.. too much to ask..

Yes. The touch-screen is the most accurate and responsive one I've ever dealt with. Unless its damaged, but even then its accurate. My friend smashed the front of his, crashing the entire region around his home button. Works perfectly fine. Multi-Touch is super nice too. You can go portrait (up) mode or landscape (holding it sideways) to enlarge your keyboard for more accurate texting/typing.
do not gwt this phone.get he new iphone 4, or atleast the 3gs. the original iphone is lame
this phone is a really good phones dont buy the 3g its waste of money and its expensive and 2g is the best one if you unlock the phone you can actually take a video and yoiou can upgrade it to 3.1.1 firm ware i think but it is a really awesome phone worth the money you can buy one for 130 to 170 thats a pretty good price for a phone

Iphone is VERY easy to unlock... you just have to find the correct firmware you are using and match it to the the JailBreak.



Ie I used Geo Hotz JB for 3.1.3 but when I moved up to FW 4 I used jailbreakme.com from my handset and it did it within 2-3 minutes.



There is a variety of software downloads that can be downloaded from the net mostly involving rain for some reason.. but it is relatively simple and I have jailbroke my iphone at least 6-7 times... then learnt how to then create my own custom themes including the awesome Pipboy theme on my iphone with icons, sounds and fallout 3 carrier.. love it.
Is this phone a good buy????


> In reply to Hurlex @ 2011-01-18 13:51 from fXKT - click to read
Its a good move if you have 9k or inside..

if you can spend 12 to 13k means get an iphone 3g..

Iphone 3g is bit hard to unlock and jaibreak it..



Kindly note this before buying the mobile..



Dono an eye to eye deal when buying the mobile.



Keep the Iphone screen in direct sunlight and check whether is there any discolor in the screen



Flash an torch light on the Headset hole on the top or see it inside under direct sun light, u will find an white mark inside..

White means the mobile has not got any water damage.

Pink or something dark means it has got some water damage..



Check for some dead pixel in the screen, 1 or 2 is ok, but more than its not good to go..



Check the housing serial number and the mobile serial number, does they match correctly..



Check the sensor near the eyer pieces works fine..



Check the loud speaker by keeping the volume full, if u get an buzzz or tearing sound means then the speaker is gone..



check the mice, ear piece, volume buttons and silent buttons works fine or not..



Use the mobile for few min and see does it get warm a bit or heat up bad..



Try using WIFI and try connecting it to an WIFI hotspot, cos day go by Iphone wifi fails..



check all the buttons function properly..



Insert your sim card and use it for making sms and some calls..



Max money can be put on a Iphone 2g 8gb is 8k and 10k to 16gb...



Dont accept the mobile without its original charger..





If Iphone fails in software wise means, its easy to fix.. checking the hardware is the must in Iphone...



Hope this helps you...every iphone is a piece of art

Iphone4 is best....but price is more

U can upgrade iphone 2g to ios 3.1.3, u cant uograde it to ios 4.0+ becoz upward of ios 4.0 apple has stopped supporting iphone 2g.... But in ios 3.1.3 you get lots of functionality and if you jailbreak your iphone then you can have almost all the functionality of ios 4.0+  like multitasking, video recording, bluetooth file transfer etc, by the help of cydia.....

and if you want to install Android froyo 2.2.1 on your iphone then you can do this also by the help of cydia, by installing Bootlace through cydia.....you can see the complete process of installing android  froyo from the below given link....

Cydia takes lot of time to load, especially if you are opening it first time, since it needs to look for all the default repositories which comes bundled with cydia.....since i had only used cydia with my edge connection i cant tell u hw much time it will take to load on wifi but i think it will take about 2 minutes to load completely..... After loading of cydia is complete you shud add some repos in cydia under manage-source tab, some important repos are 1: hackulous(for installing installous, which is hub of all the cracked app store apps.)

2: sinfuliphone repo( for cracked cydia apps)

3: xsellize repo(for cracked.cydia apps)

you can google or bing for repo domain that you need to enter in cydia.....

just be patient first time cydia will load.... :-)

does iphone 2g supports mms?Im experiencing a problem with my phone when trying to access the internet. It always tell me of the APN ERROR. How do I solve that problem? Please
Is this phone a dual sim phone?
I am using the wi-fi option om my unlocked 2G iPhone as I do not use the services of a Service Provider with Data service option. My problem is that during my visit to Colombo,Sri Lanka, a gent who was trying to be helpful accidentally reset the iPhone to factory settings. On my return to my hometown, Mumbai, India, the iPhone only shows the Edge option and though I can make outgoing calls, the incoming calls do not go through and the caller gets the message that the called number is out of coverage area. The battery charge also drains out rapidly.

Please help, what to do...
You need to downgrade the software because cydia only works with below a certain firmware - unfourtunately i don't know how to do this but ask others ???

Hi Habeeb,

One thing I want to know have you jailbroken your device, if your answer is yes then you wll be unable to download applications from app store or iTunes store...

For your problems, solutions are as follow....

1: you can open your app store account with any valid credit card of 16 digit which is standard for American credit cards, and you don't need  to be in America for this, if Apple is operating app store or iTunes store for ur country then you can easily open ur account...



2: for installing cydia you need to jailbreak ur iPhone, for jailbreaking there r no. Of softwares available on Internet, sum of the good jailbreaking s/w are, 'spirit',redsn0w, blackra1,   etc...or you can also jailbreak through internet by the help of site www.jailbreakme.com, it's easiest way of jailbreaking ur iPhone, but do remember switch if auto fill feature before using this site for jailbreaking...and you  can just google for list of more jailbreaking softwares and how to use them, but remember one thing that though jailbreaking is legalized now by the order o American court but then also ur warranty will get void on jailbreaking... But jailbreaking is real fun and it opens door for installing lots of cool applications on ur iPhone through cydia, once you jailbreak you will never want to

look back or go back to previous state..



3: to view you tube videos you need to install 'pushfix' from cydia, after installing it restart ur iPhone and you will be able to watch videos on you tube app on iPhone,and remember one thing before installing 'pushfix', switch off every applications which are using push service....

using app store to download apications on jailbroken device is impossible, but alternatively u can get all the application of app store through cydia by adding this repo to cydia in manage section, the repo is as follow....



http://cydia.hackulo.us/
. After adding this repo search for installous, under search option and install it, nw by using installous you will be able to download almost all the apps of app store... Hope I m able to help u.......

Because it's iphone...

Its regular problem in jailbroken iphones... U must be getting error. Cannot connect to you tube..... To fix this problem do one thing...... Disable all applications which r based on push notification..... Then click on cydia icon on spring board..... After cydia gets loaded u can search for ' push fix' under search option.... Nw install it.... And after installing it restart ur iphone, nw u wll be able to open you tube and all the applications which works on push notification widout ny problem..... If push fix dont works for u then there is another app for fixing push notificatiin problem in cydia its called doctor fix, try installing it, and see if it helps.....but i am sure push fix will do the job for you.... Hope i am able to helpd u...

First jailbreak ur iphone..... And then try i cycorder from cydia, icy or rock...... These all r application hub for jailbroken iphone and from there u can get many third party applications which apple has banned.......for jailbreaking tutorials u can google for more information or you can also watch videos on youtube......if u want u can also unlock ur iphone after jailbreaking, by installing unlocking software from cydia......

iphone 2g is good for speeding, but will not get you a speeding ticket.
Hi guys, I've been using the Iphone 2G for the last one and a half year. In my opinion if you want to buy any model of Iphone then please don't look at the battery back up coz you won't get it in it. It's expensive but it's has the best UI operating system in it which you won't get in any other contemporary smartphones though it lacks some of the basic features but still it's good in terms of the touchscreen quality and applications stuff.
upgarde to version 4,is it ok?what bout the battery?

Thanks to Help me people
i think iphone 2g is better than iphone 3g bcs 3g doesn't have much better qualities than 2g. 3g only has a better GPS. and 3g has a very yellow screen. and it makes you really angry. and 2g is faster.for ex.  when you start apps (like camera or safari) at the same time on 3g and 2g, you see that 2g is faster. and of course there are apps for free for 2g but there isn't any app for 3g for free. finally 3g's cover cracks causeless but 2g's cover is stronger.but of course 3gs is really really useful.

ALL iPhone users.... Does anyone know of a site that has download patches for some of the problems in iPhones?? I'm a writer and when I have an app open - and an incoming call arrives - it wipes my app off, without saving it, and all is lost. I have been told by the apple/iPhone reps that Steve Jobs is way too arrogant to admit to making a mess of this operating system.

My understanding of SMARTPHONES is that they were meant to be mobile computers. The iPhone certainly isn't with this sort of attitiude from above.

If you know of a site with repair patches please pass it on.

how to convert a MP3 format Ringtones as a I - Phone SMS Ringtone?
In the Philippines,you can have the new iPhone 3GS which is factory-unlocked (ready-to-use, ready-to-rock-on-any-sim) for about Php. 37,500.00 for the 16gb model and Php. 42,500 for the 32gb model. You may try looking at kimstore site for further info. I dont think you'd still be able to find brand new 8gb models. You may try at Globe Telecoms or maybe Smart for a lower price but you'll have to sign up for a 2-year contract i guess. Whatever suits you. but I suggest you hurry up because the phone is selling like hotcakes, and before there isn't any stock unit left for you.

u cannot change the IMEI ...IMEI is International Mobile Equipment Identity. It is a number unique to every GSM or UMTS mobile phone. It is usually printed on the case under the battery. If it is not and you have a GMS or UMTS phone, just dial *#06# and it will give you the number...so u cannnot change.

Mark, before buying do realise the difference between iphone and other touch screen phones available from mobile phone manufacturing companies. An iphone is a PDA device enabled with a mobile phone. Whereas other touch screen phones which nokia, sony ericsson or other mobile phone manufacturing industries produce are basically mobile phones enabled with PDAs. This makes a huge difference and people dont realise it and just blame apple! Iphone is not as handy as may be 5800, n97, experia, blah blah...

But having said that, it has a matchless capacitive touch! No phone has yet come up with this kind of a touch screen as that of the iphone. Now Nokia is producing X6 and sony ericcson is coming up with experia 10 to match with iphone in touch technology. The iphone's reception quality of voice is excellent. It has an ipod touch in it! The key principle to use the iphone is to install application for every thing you want to have. It works awesome with these applications and there's nothing which you cant do with the iphone and can do with other phones. Its camera is 2MP without flash but is better than many 3.2 MP cameras with flash!

Im using 2g for five months now and i am enjoying truly every bit of it. Ive upgraded the OS to 3.0 and its working excellent. My suggestion will be to go directly to 3g. It comes with OS 3.0 by default, is lighter in weight and has GPS in it. Its all black and not silver from behind like 2g. But do learn the art of installing applications as per your needs.

So if you know the art of handling technology, there is no point you shouldnt go for it!

i already saved 204 dollars

battery life please....thanks in advance

-i900 user-
I've just bought one of these to try it out before deciding on the 3g version. I've tried the Samsung Omnia, the HTC Android & the Nokia 5800. The Omnia was simply aweful!! The others were ok but i just never felt comfortable with any of them.



I've thought about the I-phone for some time but i don't like Apple's i-tunes software.



Am i making a good decision here???? or will this be another bought phone to sell on Ebay???



Thanks, Mark...

PREM, i dont feel iPHONE is worth the money. No RADIO, only 2MP CAM, No Video capture, No 3G, No GPS. So better try something in Nokia or Sony. I dont know about ur Samsung Model.
better buy nokia 1100.

Adobe website blames Apple for blocking Flash on iPhone





http://www.electronista.com/ar...y.for.flash/


"[...]Speculation suggests the software would need to utilize layers of the OS that are restricted by Apple, while others believe the issue is primarily related to excess battery drain.[...]"



Iphone's OS is not only closed source, but apple's grip is so strong that you can't even do basic tasks without apple allowing you to. This may be the fault of some unspecified hardware/sw failure, and lack of performance in the first two iPhone devices, that has not yet been disclosed.



Don't bother with a faulty device

I can't post pictures of how the N900 compares to the iPhone because I don't have it and I don't intend to have it, especially now that the N900 is a 100x better device than the iPhone and for this reason bye bye iphone helo supercomputer n900 oh by the way we can make calls on this computer aswell watch out apples the king n900 is gona get you check out the specs it speaks for itself it realy does prepare to be embarresed if your next to a n900 user people Wont be intreasted in your phone they will be dripping at the mouth over the n900 users phone n900 we hale your supremacy

U can

even I have de same phone

I upgrage my version to 3.0.1

mas fea la wea los de apple se metan el telefono por la raja maricones culiaos hijos de puta
Nokia N900 Vs Iphone 3GS



1. 3.5 inch touch-sensitive Vs 3.5-inch (diagonal) widescreen

widescreen display Multi-Touch diplay

Resistive screen Capacitative Screen



Resistive screen has the advantage of point accuracy. This is good for hand writing because unlike apple, nokia is a all over the world so it has to cater to differnt popluations and some people espcially the asians prefer hand writing recognition for their myriad languages. But capacitative has the advantage of being more responsive. Although it has its side effects, being that it cannot be used with anything except your bare finger. This is really a pain especially for the North east states of the Us and Northern Europe in the cold climates. You cant navigate well with gloves. Another advantage of capacitative is that multi-touch so it is very useful in games and other actions like pinching etc. As far as i know this is the only advantage of the iphone compared to the n900 and of course the other being the app store. But both of these can be expected in the near future with more developers flocking to maemo due to its open nature.



2. 800 ï¿½ 480 pixel resolution @ 225 ppi Vs 480-by-320-pixel resolution at 163 ppi



This is one area where the n900 totally burns the iphone. Basically resolution means the number of lines you can see on the screen. For example most of the laptops are about 1280 x 800. Since it is very near to that resolution on the n900 you can view web pages just like on your desktop without much zooming and panning. You just open the web page and read no need to keep on fiddling with the text to read which makes web browsing very comfortable



This is included within the sales package. What you can do with is that you can connect your phone to the tv using those 3(yellow, white and red connectors). Imagine playing games with your accelerometer on the big screen. It is fun. And of course you can directly play the recorded videos, images on the big screen. Here again the higher resolution helps by displaying the video on a bigger size and better clarity on the tv.



4. Micro-USB connector, High-Speed USB 2.0 Vs C



5.Bluetooth v2.1 including support Vs Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR

for stereo headsets



This feature is the same on both the phones. But with n900 you can send any file via the bluetooth. The iphone even though it has the hardware, deliberately clamps down that feature. The n900 supports tethering, meaning that you can use its data connection to connect to another device like a laptop. I heard even apple allows that these days... but also have heard that it is not possible on AT&T. So basically you cant do it on the iphone whereas you can do anything you want on the n910.





6. Integrated FM transmitter Vs None



An Fm transmitter transmits the audio/video out from the device into radio frequency. So you can tune your car radio into that frequency and listen to the media on the phone wirelessly. Basically this removes the additional audio jack going out of the device into the tape slot of the car stereo. This is a great advantage for car owners. Since i do not have a tape player in my car i use a stand alone fm transmitter. The biggest problem i have with the stand alone transmitter is that it takes the charging port in my car and so i cannot charge my phone. Now no more wires and i can use the charging port to charge my phone while the fm transmitter does its thing.Although it is not listed there i assume there is also fm receiver also. You can listen to the local radio stations and also the fm reciever could be use for traffic updates to your maps application.



7. Up to 1GB of application memory Vs 256 mb only

(256 MB RAM, 768 MB virtual memory)



The main advantage is that you could use your swap memory to open many applications simultaneously. Wheras in the iphone you have to have only one application at one time except for the phone and audio applications. This is just like your desktop. You can open any no. of applications and just switch between them. For example on the iphone if you are instant messaging some one and you want to just check something on the browser, the moment you press the browser window you are logged out of the chat. On the n900 everything is open and you are still logged in and you get a notification when you get an Im. You just need to switch widows and select what you want to do.



8. 32 GB internal storage Vs 16GB or 32GB flash drive

Up to 16 GB of additional storage None

with an external microSD card



9. Full QWERTY tactile keyboard Vs Only on-screen keyboard.

Full QWERTY onscreen keyboard



This is a very big win for the n900.



10. Quad-band GSM EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 Vs UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) WCDMA 900/1700/2100 MHz GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)



11. Integrated hands-free stereo speakers Vs Mono speaker



Stereo speakers means that there are 2 speakers on both sides of the device giving a more comprehensive sound. Since there are 2 speakers it is great for listening to songs in a group and also podcasts and videos just like you would listen to stereo speakers on your tv or laptop. The sound also should be very loud and more importantly more clear.



12. Internet calling Vs None



This means voip calls can be made using the n900. For example skype, gtalk etc. This can considerably reduce the money spent on international calling. Even the iphone has gtalk and skype but the major problem is with multi tasking. If you are on a skype call you cannot use the phone for anything else. Infact if you are waiting for a skype/gtalk call you have to keep the app open and not try to open any other part of the phone. On the n900 you can just keep them open while you do your work and you will be notified of a call or im when you get it.Also there is a webcam for video calls. I could make phone to phone video calling if the other person is on gtalk on another n900. Full video calling will be soon coming.



13. Maemo browser powered by Mozilla technology Vs Safari without flash.

Adobe Flashï¿½ 9.4 support



14. Pre-loaded Ovi Maps application Vs None



15. 5 megapixel camera (2584 ï¿½ 1938 pixels) Vs # 3 megapixels Autofocus

CMOS sensor, Carl Zeiss optics, Tessar lens

3 ï¿½ digital zoom

Dual LED flash



Here again there is really no comparison. The dual led helps to capture good clarity photos even in low light conditions. I dont know if there is zoom on the iphone but the n900 has 3x digital zoom. Then there is photo tagging which is useful for tagging pictures.



16. Video recording at up to 848 ï¿½ 480 pixels Vs VGA(640x480) up to 30 fps with audio

(WVGA) and up to 25fps



The n900 records at a higher resolution although the fps is low.



17. Video playback file formats: Vs Cannot play wmv, .avi formats.

.mp4, .avi, .wmv, .3gp;

codecs: H.264, MPEG-4, Xvid, WMV, H.263



Since maemo is open source you could install mplayer for free and play additional formats like divx, flv and other formats. Iphone can play only a few apple supported formats. This is a big deal because most of the videos can be downloaded from the internet directly and played without any conversion. Unfortunately for the iphone you cannot save the videos directly. You need to save them using your pc then convert them and transfer them for later viewing. This is a PITA!



18. Background pictures Vs None.



Since the n900 has a panoromic desktops with support upto 4 active desktops, you could have different cool backgroud wallpapers for each desktop. Since the app icons are always present on the iphone there is really no use of the desktop and you can only have one desktop wall paper.



19. Widgets on your desktops Vs None



Widgets are really good for real time updates. You can have as many widgets as you want on mutliple desktops. you can have gtalk widget with real time online status. Rss widget with real time updates, internet radio widget, weather widget etc. Widget help you check the latest updates without opening the application. for example if you need to check what are your upcoming applications.... on the iphone you have to go into the calender application and then check it... wheras on the n900 you just have a glance at your desktop and you see your calender. This is very useful.



20. Intelligent contact shortcuts Vs None



Here again you can directly place a contact on one of your desktops and with one single click you can call or email the contact. Wheras in the iphone you have to go to contacts ans locate the contact and then initaite the call. Same goes for sending an email or sms or internet call.



21. PDF reader Vs Safari handles pdf



22. Sketch Application Vs None



23. Removable Battery Vs Non removable

Yesterday afternoon another iPhone has exploded at a security guard who was French by typing a text message.The screen is split, causing a slight injury to one eye.



Another iPhone explodes in France!



Yassine Bouhadi, an unfortunate 26 year old who works as a security guard at a supermarket in Villevieille. We have repeatedly talked about these kinds of incidents that are occurring at a rate quite close in recent months.

iphone is completely different from other phones. itunes is the universal software for all iphones till now (2g,3g,3gs). you don't need any specific drivers disc, or software etc. all you need to do is:

1.download itunes from "www.apple.com".

2.install it.

3.launch it.

4.connect ur iphone.

5.itunes will automatically detect the iphone and will display it in left navigation pane.

5. click the iphone and then in right pane u will see all the options u have. u can transfer music, ringtones, movies/videos, software from the menu.

All u need is itunes my friend. there is no software cd etc for iphone.

Greetings.



That happens when your Iphone was bought in an opperator, and your Sim Card was bougth in a DIFFERENT opperator.



Your Iphone will not be able again, until you put a correct Sim Card.



This can happens too, when your Sim Card doesnt have a data package.



Good luck

Hi nil, did u try to connect ur iphone to itunes on ur pc? i think when u connect it to itunes it will display message that 'itunes found iphone in DFU mode,(device firmware upgrade) click restore button to restore iphone to default settings'. keeping ur pc connected to internet click the restore button. it will download the firmware from internet and upload it to iphone. (warning: all ur existing data on the iphone will be lost). after this upgrade u may see that u get emergency calls only screen. and in itunes u get message that 'sim or network not recognized'. this means ur iphone is now locked.

you didn't mention in ur post that which iphone u r using? iphone 2g or 3g? and u r mac user or pc?

hi ria, as far as i understood ur question. you want to question about why iphone can't make video? if so then u can capture video by installing free software from cydia named 'cycorder'. u can make unlimited video and quality is also good.


> In reply to fares @ 2009-06-07 06:03 from 3IK8 - click to read
Hi fares, ur question is not clear. if you want to use internet on iphone then u don't need to have cydia. iphone comes with built-in safari web browser and u can connect to internet via built-in wifi or GPRS. CYDIA, means the iphone is jailbroken, and u can find cydia on iphone easily by going through the screens. its not hidden. its icon is prominenet and can easily be located.
why is there no video in this iPhone?

how can i take videos?

DO NOT unzip firmware file. Just erease the extension .zip, or change to .ipsw

NEVER try to downgrade firmware- it is possible,but it's very difficult for beginners.You have to be Very skilled to do this!

you already bought iphone or not? you have to jailbreak it first to have ibluetooth working. if u don't know how to do it, let me know. then you have to follow few easy steps to install ibluetooth.

1.Open cydia,

2.Tap on search, and then type ibluetooth.

3.you can see "iBluetooth from iSapzio". tap it.

4.Tap on "install" button on right top, and then tap again on "confirm".

after installation is finished you have the "iBluetooth" icon on your spring board. Tap it to launch application.

I personaly installed it on my iphone, and its working great for me.

contact me if you have any difficulties. email is aamir@tanoli.us
i can  see  another that  is CTC one copy of  aple .

There's no any other touch screen brings you such smooth feeling but not too sensative and also simple just one home key as I-phone. I tried a whole bunch other brands, nothing satisfied me, I just never wanna go back to key board...

how do u send a picture via bluetooth to a Nokia with this phone?
This phone is really very cool. I used many touchscreen phone but i-phone is winner on this for sure. I -phone touchscreen interface is better than all & internet browsing specially you tube feature,weather & email is really very attractive & easy to use.



But this phone has lack of some basic phone & multiMedia features. Like Can't read the contacts in your sim card . you need to enter manually or thru Outlook ( its pain). Only 2 megapixle camera without video recording support & flash.

No support for user selected Mp3 ringtones.. I dont know why Apple missed these very common features of phone.



I think adding these featuers will make this phone best & perfect.

It's ok imo. Has some major downsides, but the people who use it don't seem too concerned with those features. Only thing that ticks me off as a retailer is Apple's warranty policies... >.>



Whoever said it doesn't have customisable wallpapers- you can use any picture in your gallery as a wallpaper (just as with most phones), and it comes with several defaults to choose from.

find someone in cellphone shops to unlock your iphone, and never update it again because an iphone carrying a network will always lock again when you updated it to a new software version, because it goes back to the default phone settings like it was first bought, and iphone 2G are all locked to a network. only the iphone 3G has the legally unlock version that can update to a new software version and will remain unlock.

as far as i can listen music and watch videos through this iphone this one is good. but poor in software applications... too bad.The one thing i do not like is it does not have picture messeging. Otherwise it is a great phone
iPhone is not a perfect phone it has many flaws. The phone which dosen't share data via bluetooth is not a perfect phone. Nokia phones are perfect phones. In iPhone u can here music, just for music u can even buy a iPod which is much cheaper then a iPhone. So please don't waste your hard earned money on the hard chunk of metal/plastic its all bull shit. Buy a phone which can do multiple things. Buy a phone with a good camera, bluetooth sharning, good output speakerphone so that you can here your ringtone at a good volume, buy a phone which can forward sms without installing third party applications. I don't know why people like to wase money on things like iPhone. I am a very old user of iPhone & still didn't find anything good about this stupid phone.

iphone's bluetooth service is just for headset support only means that, u cant share music or picture from one mobile to another even if you want to..
The iphone, this could be classed as apples first phone comibining there world renowed ipod with a state of the art pocket pda boosting an accleromiter (for motion sensing, with is quyickly becoming a common feture in most new media based phones and smart phones) and a unique new feture, only on the iphone the multi finger touch screen allowing pinching and stretching aswell as many other finger combinations, this phone putting a side it's screen, uses a form of OSX (an operating system used by Apple) which would make this phone UNIX based.

The pone it's self is nothing speacil it has a cross linked phone book which allows you to make phone calls bring up maps of the address, and does what most phones would, it is also an ipod so it will of course link up with itunes (windows or Mac) and be fully interactive with both, it,s biggist selling point is widgets,( small aplications run under the operating system) these little widgets can very from a simple spirit level to a full game, it's phisical form ie the phone it has a hard screen so you are not likely to damage the screen useing evey day ware and tare, the nack is a nice polished stainless steel and has a hard button on the front to bring you to the main menu (defult, this buttion is a soft key and able to change function to corispond with the program)



The phone is at the momment retaling about ï¿½342 8GB & ï¿½391 16GB from 02 but is also avalible on contract(which is as of the moment recomended if you wish to take advantage of the features) as far as function goes this phone for the price you are paying i would say is not worth the money, it is more a fasion item then a functional phone worthy of the price, if you are after an ipod with wifi and all the gimky features i would recomend the much cheaper ipod touch which start at ï¿½165 (at time pf post) there is of course the forgoten and unpopuler motorola Rokr which had itunes built in, (with a mod see motomoders you can exspand the limited 100 sond download limit,WARNING THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED OR RECOMENDED BY MOTOROLA AND WILL VOID ANY WARRENTEE) but as far as recomendations go there are many cheaper phones on the market which do a lot of the features this phone does at half the cost
From where to download the software for the GPS of my iphone 8G????????????? thanks

you cant use the bluetooth to send or receive data if that is what u mean... the only way you can use bluetooth is for wireless headsets or other devices... of course those devices have got to be apple devices... no other brands will be able to be paired with the iphone... sorry...


> In reply to Saurabh @ 2008-12-29 13:41 from utm9 - click to read
You can not use your bluetooth like others. It's just for headphones and music. No data transfer is available.

You have USB & WiFi.
ohhh wel josh, becz ur a mammy's boy u get wat she pays for ini. the new tocco f480 has a 5mp camera and its gr8t for takin naughty pics if u now wat i mean lolas y name sugests i m not a big fan of apple products never have been never will be most of it is overpriced, and a better alternative is often availible, the ipods- creative zen kicks their butt, the macs- a ood quaility pc kicks thier butt, and the iphone- well several phones are far better- the samsung tacco and omnia,the nokia n95 and n96 the lg renoir and cookie and the sony erricson x1, and i believe on a ï¿½35 contract (which is the minimum iphon e contract where you have to pay ï¿½200 for the phone) they are all avilible free.

so don't by the iphone just cause apple says they are the best or because your mate has one. there are a lot of better phones on the market just walk in to carphone warhouse and they have a full wall (or stand) of better phones for you to choose from.

WORST PHONE EVER DON'T BUY IT  !

I've been using this phone for a year and it's rubbish nothing good about it.

It lacks of basic functions that other phones have !

No bluetooth ! No proper sms sending ! No sim import function ! No proper calendar reminder ! No video function ! Calculator doesn't calculate correctly !

No function on how long you have talked ! Very difficult in understanding the incoming calls and outgoing calls ! No single phone entry removal ! No fast dial up like other phones ! No custom music !

No custom wallpaper ! Bad 2 MP camera !

Everything has to be done using the stupid iTunes that crashes quit offen !

No MP3 allowed ! only AAC format and just 30 sec for a custom ring tone allowed stupid whe you have 4-8-16 GB of space !

You have to relay on programs that were later developed by enthusiast not by APPLE to help you overcome the problems that APPLE didn't take care because they were in a hurry to relese the phone, but they didn't realise that it will be complete failure and bad image yes they did sold 4 million iphones but people once used it saw what rubbish it is !

Basically this phone is not good ! Don't ever buy it!

Some of the problems are the same in the 3G ver. !

They haven't fix those problems !

People don't be fooled by the way it looks !

Buy Sony Ericsson and you will see a quality product!

I will never buy APLLE product again !!!



i love iphone so muchhhhhhhhh

the best phone in my live

muachhhhhhhhh iphone...
iPhone is the best mobile touchscreen phone ever!!!!



To those who posted negative comment against iphone,

i would say "everyone has its own preferences and likes, if you dont want the things that you possess, just let go of it and find something that suits your desire".

my mom use it and she hated it..

want a touch screen phone then this one is the best available in the market i think
complete wast of money, u can get phones that do twice as much and for half the price, please wake up people
hey pple, iphone is coming to kenya in a few days through orange, i was thinking of getting one but it looks so simple, it has few functionalities en it seems tht it will be outdated within a short time. apart from the multi touch which is not all tht important, it seems tht i will be forced to compromise alot if i buy this one. my next option is either SE P1 or G900? I wanted to get an ipod en a new phone en now tht they are integrated, am still undecided if to go for? is there anyone out there who has been in such a situation. pls advice.
can some1 tell me how many days does the iphone batery last with normal use....but with music applications? thnx

you get to access the apps stores from 2.1

thats why people are upgrading
why do ppl upgrade to 2.1 version..wats wrong with the old version??
Anyone interested to purchase this Iphone 2G? It's a brand new phone at negotiable price.
i have installed 2.1 version on my i phone.but its installer has very few things to offer.how do i download basic softwares like sim port
where can i get cheap lcd replacement. ebay has for 159$. anything cheaper then that?
Hey for the guy who said "one drop and your done" thats not entirly correct cuz my uncles iphone got run over by a toyota noah and it just suffered a few dents on the back

by the way, it wasnt in the shell
seriously i was one of the biggest haters of iphone from the very start.. but when i actually bought one.. i was quite surprised that this phone has no boundaries.. i thought it lacks on lots of feat.. but i was so wrong.. good thing there's jailbreak with iphone.. i super love my phone!i have the iphone 16gb and its is a great device for ,some,things, but it still missing some essential things that any other phone has since the last century..I WOULD LOVE THE NEW FIRMWARFE WITH THIS FEATURES...



1.please enable bluetooth sharing of files

2.enable copy/paste option

3.enable mms(integrated,not by a third party soft]

4.enable mass storage

5.enable audio input (to record audio instrument or vocal,it would be great)

6.make the new sms inbox,like any normal phone..this one sucks..

7.fm radio would be great also...



THIS COULD BE THE ULTIMATE IPHONE DEVICE...I HOPE YOU AGREE WITH ME..



REGARDS
The Apple iphone has no Bluetooth 4 sending data (fotos,music files etc) only 4 headset.It is the most disastrous phone till date.I can't understand y people r running behind Apple iphone.Y can't people go 4 Nokia,Sony Ericsson, Samsung,Blackberry etc which r 1000 times better than the stupid iphone.

I had the opportunity of choosing between the Iphone, Nokia N95 and Nokia N82.  I would never buy the Iphone.The N95 is awesome..Finally I decided to get the N82. It was the perfect choice. Iphone is not a bad phone. But I'll wait to a better Iphone, best camera. Maybe later, Iphone will be as good as It should be...When Iphone gets better, Nokia will improve their phones too. And, for that reason I will buy Nokia phones..:-)

If you are in Malaysia, you can buy a brand new iPhopne 3G 8GB or 16GB Black/ White in any of the major shopping malls. Prices are very different compare shop to shop, so better check around. I say average is RM3000 for a fully unlocked version with 2.01 or 2.1.1 OS.
this phone is real great, i love it. best phone ever made, and the sound is awesome as well
it is the most stunning phone the world has never seen...just buy this...for browsing u have the worlds fastest browser SAFARI..ultimate clarity of videos.go for it
dnT GET THIS ONE OR IPHONE 3G....battery goes down soon...not worth it!!!!!!!

check SONY ERISSON G705,C07 OR S500I the best

No better to restore your phone 1st and then reinstall your programs. At the moment the most stable OS for it is still the 1.1.4. However you can also upgrade it to 2.1.1.



I suggest that you take your phone to an expert. The best I know if PDArena in Sunway Pyramid. They are very good. Go there and ask for Darren. They will fix your phone at a small Fee. Remember that you have a choice of keeping the 1.1.4 or upgrade it to 2.1.1.



Good luck and enjoy your phone.

I Agree, the iphone 2G is better than the 3G in many ways. In Malaysia you can buy Unlocked iPhone 3G in black and white 8 and 16GB from all major shops. I actualy know people who buy them and ask for downgrade to 1.1.4. I also know people who have problem of reception and call drops. I have the iPhone 2G for almost 6 month now and I will never change it to the 3G. They are identical and if you look you can see the that the colours are better in 2G than the 3G. If you upgrade the 2G to 2.1.1, then you have a phone that is same as the 3G. So keep iot and be proud of it.

Hello,

i tried  loading an application but instead my i fone turned blank,i can only recieve and a message kips poppin readin 'erasing i-phone'

i dont know if anyone has a solution to dis problem.
its shape is original somehow: thin,slim and compact...



its a really rigid, its built from steel and heavy metals, and glass for the screen!



big storage, take advantage in jailbreaking it to experience all its abilities.



upgrading and downgrading can not be as simple as you might think, it's really difficult especially if you use another worldwide gsm service!



it has a lack of bluetooth:S bluetooth is not made to share files.



i've had it, it's been 5 months, it's a totally different user experience, i love it and i'm gonna keep it:D
my iphone keeps on hanging, is it normal...im just afraid maybe it is already damaged?...y is it hanging? pls answer
when will the iphone be available on orange?
i had this phone for a couple of days and before i had n958gb, TO THE PEOPLE FROM APPLE:

YOU HAVE TO MAKE A NEW FIRMWARE 3.0 NOW....

it needs..

-bluetooth conection like any other phone

-better camera

-mass storage mode

-replaceable battery

-flash light

-reliable software(os)that wont freeze...

-reduce the level of radiation from the phone

-ms office word and excel so we can edit word and excel files

-support more audio and video formats

-to be able to use any bluetooth handsfree headphones(not just apple)

-tv out 9to be able to conect with a normal audio/video cable to any tv...



otherwise its a great hardware phone with a briliant display and graphics

First of all A.T.T is not the superior company t-mobile is when it comes to gsm. Second of all the iphone is a phone worth spending money which if you dont want to spend alot of money on this phone you shouldnt even consider buying it.And finally if it breaks and you have the money to buy the phone im pretty much sure that you can pay to fix it.

!!! BEWARE OF BUYING iPhone 3G!!!



Friends.....those of you in India planning for iPhone... THINK TWICE BEFORE MAKING A DECISION... The short comings of iPhone are endless...





No video calling,



no AD2P on the Bluetooth,



CAN'T share ANY (mp3, images,videos....) files via bluetooth,



can't use as a wireless modem, (you pay ridiculous data charges to activate internet on your phone, but cannot connect it to your PC and browse when you are at home)



no copy and paste,(cannot copy a part of a.... say.... email & send it....have to type it out yourself)



no 3.2 or 5 megapixel camera,(the 2MP camera it carries is worst camera i've ever seen..... photos look like they have come out of a VGA camera)



no video recording with camera,



no front camera,



no flash.



no JAVA support



No physical keyboard (BELIEVE me! this alone is a dealbreaker...touch keyboard as good as it looks...once you use it then only you come to know about the importance of having a hard keypad)



No 3G network yet in India..so why pay for expensive 3G phone if you cant use its 3G services ... so, for India, iPhone 2.0 is no better than its first version



No removable battery. (You cannot change battery. Have to send it to apple outlet.. Come on now!!!!...This is not an iPod. Its a bloody phone. You cannot live without phone for 2-3 days)



No haptic feedback and



cannot send MMS,



can't use as external storage device (16 GB of utter waste..next time you go to your friend's house & find some interesting songs, movies, etc...sorry you cannot connect your '16 GB' phone and share it!!!! Apple apparently has a solution.. " BUY MUSIC & MOVIES FROM iTUNES STORE "..... Give me a break will you APPLE!!!)



no FM radio,



can't use your mp3 files as ringtones,(This is heights man!!!)



cannot insert any other SIM cardï¿½.



completely tied to iTunes... Connect to your friend's iTunes & you risk erasing everything on your phone.



list goes on & on & onï¿½.







We Indians are used to these features. Most of our phones already have these features. & we cannot do with out them.... i mean can you imagine paying so much for a phone with which you cannot transfer files via bluetooth. what age is this ...STONE AGE???



Some features may be activated by jailbreak.. But why the hell should you risk losing your warranty after paying so much.



And want to add third party softwares??.. YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM FROM iTUNES STORE ONLY!!! . (Shell out more money). Apple is a bloody control freak. Dont surrender your freedom to it.



Its good for american market (who have no idea what mobile freedom/choice is) which is in stone age compared to asian/european markets. When they want to buy a phone, they have to go to network operators and buy only those phones that are available on that network. & stick to that company till their contract expires. You want to change carriers? Not before paying damages, & buying another phone on the other network again.



On the contrary, we in India have so much freedom. We go to handset shops & buy which ever phone we like. Then go to carriers.. checkout the plans & buy SIM. Dont like the plan or rival carrier came up with a better plan???? EASY . just remove & replace the SIM.



Apple are trying to IMPOSE THEIR MODEL ON US riding on the hype iPhone has created in the US (yes it was a flop in Europe .thats why Apple never talks about its sales in Europe).



Dont fall for the subsidized price of iPhone... CHECKOUT THE DATA PLAN ATTACHED TO ITS SIM ..they will recover the cost through ridiculous data plans. Bill might come to around Rs 2500/month.(ATLEAST AMERICANS PAY THAT MUCH)



Let me clear one thing though.. iphone is the best looking phone (its touch interface is nothing like you have ever seen ), & best browsing experience out there no doubt .... (& others are fast catching up..check out the android demo at Google IO 2008).... BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO FUNCTIONALITY...



Those of who buy it... You will be most happy for atmost a week... & then, MARK MY WORDS...YOU WILL START REGRETTING IT!!!





My advice...WAIT FOR HTC DREAM!! (powered by android). Still not convinced by then...by all means go for iPhone...



So friends lets spread this info to all our friends and help them in making a wise decision.... & those of you who have bought unlocked versions already please share your experiences with others



THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.... GOODLUCK!!!

- 2 MP camera without flash, Autofocus, No video recording.

- Higher End Phone without java

- No FM radio (one of the main features now a days)with recording

- Can't change battery, can't remove SIM

- Need to keep on paying for every thing - - iTumes.

-FM Radio with recording & 2 Mega Pixel camera not enough must & should for iphone

Basic needs which has to be added.without this iphone is not worth





Hey guys, just updated the iPhone to the 2.0 firmware... The iPhone just got way better... Now apps are free over Apple app store... Many new and improved features... The iPhone has just got a new life... One of the best phone... it rocks...
the apple iphone has taken an inordinately long time to come to india the fastest growing mobile telephone market . about 6 million mobile handsets are sold in a month in india.apple has tied up with vodafone and bharti service providers but still they have not launched the i phone.

a suggestion apple can introduce the first generation i phone as 3g is not in india as yet.as and when 3g is introduced an upgrade to the iphone can be done by the service providers. also meanwhile apple store can be set up.this is in view of the fact that it may happen nokia launches n96 and google launches the g phone before apple iphone in india . all the hype and waiting shall become stale .

warmest regards

my iphons in  refresh mode or something how to\get out please answer????
I was gonna buy an iPhone until I read your guys comments. NOW I'M GONNA BUY 4.
i use the Apple Iphone but my only problem with the phone is, it hooks attimes and i have to wait for the battery to run down. and the conectivity is not other phones friendly.
c'mon! MMS, 3G.Crap camera?



MMS problem, use the browser and send tons of Pictures and videos via e-mail.



3G connection still very expensive.

why you want this feature if you never use?

why? just to show other people you have 3G? don't bother.



crap 2MP camera? buy 10MP to 12MP camera instead, Nokia, SE, Samsung camera isn't enough if you really wish to have nice resolution.



you are paying for the OS X and muli-touch screen. if you don't like the iPhone then stick to your stone age Windows mobile or mobile crap. buy this first before give negative feedback. Jeezz!
The short comming of the iphone I belive are things that should not be overed looked especially when you pay so much for a phone and my nices $20.00 go-phone can do more....its really insulting. For example you can not send nor recive picture messages, or MSM texting you recive a cod

the thing is revolutionary.. maybe thats what u cant handle? shortcomings this shortcomings that.. maybe its only in india that u have to be so scared bout jailbreakin n stuff.. it's easy enough.. i've done it on many iphones.. not one with a problem yet.. jailbreak it.. add the awesome 3rd party apps available now.. and u wont have any of the problems u complain bout.. from zooming the camera to bluetooth file transfer to using ur iphone as a mass storage device.. and come on.. the pics are as bad as a VGA cam? have u even touched an iphone?!?!?!

I'm not trying to sell this phone, this phone does have many downsides, but what w4dy said, isn't all true at all. Don't be fooled by people who don't go deep enough into the picture.



Make your own decision based on ALL the facts. I've had it all, N958GB, N95, N73, N80, LG Prada, W880i, RAZR 2 Luxury, 8800 Sirocco etc etc, this is the ONLY phone I don't regret buying.
People who advises others not to buy this phone, because of, let's say, AD2P bluetooth or MMS, Camera functionality, there are features that outweighs these, such as revolutionary touchscreen, music player etc. You can't have everything in a phone, like in all things, you have to choose & priorities what you need and want, and go from there.



Plus, iPhone CAN BE used as storage & it can record video, 2MP camera is bad true, compared to the BEST camera phones out there, but it's actually not that bad, they produce OK quality pictures in light conditions. Most of the problems mentioned by w4andy can be fixed anyway. So do not utter rubbish. If you do, then make sure you've actually researched on it.
Those finding faults with the iphone don't get the point. I have always thought that Apple makes unnecessarily expensive and hyped products when there are other products with more value. But the moment I saw an iphone in operation, what struck me was the iphone UI. It's revolutionary, and this actually is a fitting description, not just a marketing tag. The iphone UI is as revolutionary, not just for cellphones but for all kinds of computers, as antenna less cellphones were revolutionary. And the iphone's UI is the most fluid and smoothest unlike the UI of its quick to market copycats HTC and Samsung.

Get a Centro, old OS and nothing fancy but it does a lot of jobs done (functional) with thousands of available applications. A lot faster and stable compared to others. You may wish that it should have this and that but definitely it's worth it. Just try to enumerate the possibilities. You'll notice that they outnumber the shortcomings.This Phone is a Lemon!!!!

1. it hangs.

2.no zoomin in camera.

best gadjet if you only want to show off.

otherwise is big, no bluetooth transmission, no 3g(the old one) ,no video recording, only 2mp camera. compare to n95 8gp is nothing.

the only advantages are the nice screen and easy to browsing
Its the best gadget you can buy urself.
